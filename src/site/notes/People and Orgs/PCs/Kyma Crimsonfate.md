	  Father: Still figuring out, city bound by more than contract, chains, companion, something else, bring allies, meet you here, come through [[People and Orgs/People/Traxagor\|Traxagor]]
	- It mentions to bring [[People and Orgs/People/The Companion\|The Companion]] who is a celestial Planar ally who got rid of the vampires from the city of [[Places/Eltaurel/Elturel\|Elturel]].

## Sending
- As the short rest ends [[People and Orgs/PCs/Kyma Crimsonfate\|Kyma]] gets a sending from his father 	- Father: Limit, sending uses. They're listening. Demon deals work differently. Stay away from me at all costs. No matter what.
	- Kyma: I'll weigh my options to see how heavy the cost. Please try to stay safe. I will too.

### Lane Approaches Me
-  If [[People and Orgs/PCs/Kyma Crimsonfate\|Kyma]] talks to his father a contract will be completed and we will be marked for death 
	- He is only telling Me and [[People and Orgs/PCs/Bras\|Bras]]
- Looking around I notice far in the back distance a small war machine, probably a motorcycle
