When he first showed up he was small, as he died over and over he has progressively gotten stronger. He seems to show an ability to adapt to our commonly used spells/attacks. He shows a general ability to adapt in general. 
**Pain Encounters**
1. In front of [[Places/Eltaurel/Torm's Bridge\|Torm's Bridge]], he climbed out of a sewer grate and [[People and Orgs/PCs/Kyma Crimsonfate\|Kyma]] burnt him with acid 
2. Outside of [[Places/Eltaurel/High Hall\|High Hall]], he turned his hands to knives and [[People and Orgs/PCs/Eamonn\|People and Orgs/PCs/Eamonn]] killed him with an eldritch blast
3. Inside the ossuary of [[Places/Eltaurel/High Hall\|High Hall]]'s Chapel. One of his eyes looks to be the colour of my eldrich blast, the other is orange. 
4. He ambushes us on our way down the chains from [[Places/Eltaurel/Elturel\|Elturel]]. When he sees me wearing the same amulet he is he says "What? You!? I will not accept that!!!". He gets pushed off the chain but grows wings to fly. I steal his crimson amulet of his corpse before later selling it to [[People and Orgs/People/Mad Maggie\|Mad Maggie]]. 
5. He ambushes us as we are resting at Mad Maggie's, holding a knife to Lulu's throat. Here is where he first binds one of us ([[People and Orgs/PCs/Eamonn\|People and Orgs/PCs/Eamonn]]) to his forced contract after collecting all of our names.  To enact the contract he seems to need to clap his hands together.
He wants and not has all of our names. He seems to be able to use them to force us into a contract which binds us to him, making the one bound be inflicted with any wound inflicted onto Pain
