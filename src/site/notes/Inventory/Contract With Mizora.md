# Infernal Compact of Patronage and Liberation

  

KNOW ALL CREATURES, BOTH MORTAL AND IMMORTAL, that upon this day, within the flaming dominion of [[Places/Avernus/Avernus\|Avernus]], First of the Nine Hells, an agreement is herein drafted and set forth between [[People and Orgs/Mizora\|Mizora]], Advocate of the Pit, duly invested with infernal authority and sovereign rights of compact (hereinafter referred to as “[[People and Orgs/Mizora\|the Infernal Patron]]”), and [[People and Orgs/PCs/Eamonn\|Eamonn Chrysocolla]] (hereinafter referred to as “[[People and Orgs/PCs/Eamonn\|the Bound Party]]”).

  

## ARTICLE I. Consideration and Grant of Boon

  

The Infernal Patron, by right of pact and compact, shall:

a. Release the Bound Party from servitude and binding oaths owed to any former patron, spirit, genie, or elemental sovereign, including but not limited to the Dao herein unnamed.

b. Transfer of Patronage: Thereafter, [[People and Orgs/PCs/Eamonn\|the Bound Party]] shall derive (eldritch, faculties,) ==puissance, (and) might==, ~~and eldritch faculties~~ solely and entirely from the Infernal Patron.

c. Lantern Custody: Upon the ==satisfactory fulfillment of obligations defined in this Compact==, the Infernal Patron shall relinquish custody and ownership of the Lantern of the Dao into the possession of the Bound Party.

d. Safeguard of Kin: Until such time as [[People and Orgs/PCs/Eamonn\|the Bound Party]] departs the Nine Hells, or until a formal discussion has been undertaken regarding the liberation of his family ==after the [[Magic Items not owned/Sword of Zariel\|Sword of Zariel]] is accounted for==, the Infernal Patron shall ensure the continued safety, preservation, and non-destruction of the Bound Party’s family, though not necessarily their freedom.

e. Conditional Redemption Clause: At a time and circumstance of the Infernal Patron’s sole determination, and upon the fulfillment of further covenants not presently enumerated but subject to future negotiation, the Bound Party shall be granted opportunity to secure the liberation of his family from ==bondage, damnation, or servitude.==

  

## ARTICLE II. Duties, Oaths, and Allegiances

  

[[People and Orgs/PCs/Eamonn\|the Bound Party]] pledges perpetual loyalty to [[People and Orgs/Mizora\|the Infernal Patron]], to act in her interests with diligence, zeal, and discretion.

  

Minor Services: At [[People and Orgs/Mizora\|the Infernal Patron]]’s request, the Bound Party shall undertake sundry tasks, errands, and assignments. While these shall ordinarily be subject to mutual agreement, the Infernal Patron reserves the right to impose, without recourse, up to three (3) such compulsory services during the term of this Compact, to be executed faithfully and without delay, refusal constituting breach.

  

Prohibitive Clause ([[Magic Items not owned/Sword of Zariel\|Sword of Zariel]]): Under no circumstance shall the Bound Party allow, permit, assist, or suffer his satyr companion or dwarf companion to claim or wield the [[Magic Items not owned/Sword of Zariel\|Sword of Zariel]]. Willful prevention of this outcome is deemed a material condition of this Compact.

  

Audience Mandate: The Bound Party, together with his companions, shall ensure an audience with [[People and Orgs/Deities and Beings of Power/Bel\|Bel]], Pit Fiend of Avernus, prior to the recovery or wielding of the aforementioned [[Magic Items not owned/Sword of Zariel\|Sword of Zariel]]. This clause admits of no deviation, delay, or avoidance.

  

## ARTICLE III. Penalties for Breach

  

Should the Bound Party willfully or negligently breach any clause of this Compact, the following sanctions shall, without need of arbitration, be enacted:

a. The Bound Party shall immediately and irrevocably fall under the enchantment of a Geas (7th Tier), compelling obedience to the Infernal Patron.

b. The Bound Party’s mortal essence shall be transfigured into a lesser fiendish state, form and function at the Infernal Patron’s discretion.

c. Upon natural death, violent death, or disincorporation, the Bound Party’s soul shall be forfeit to the Infernal Patron, to be claimed, tormented, bartered, or consumed according to infernal law and pleasure.

  

## ARTICLE IV. Duration and Enforcement

  

This Compact remains binding and eternal until such time as it is formally dissolved by the Infernal Patron in writing, sealed with her sigil, or until the Bound Party is destroyed in both body and soul.

  

Enforcement of this Compact shall be witnessed and upheld by the Baatezu hierarchy of Avernus, and no plea, petition, or divine intervention shall abrogate its terms unless expressly permitted by the Lord of Nessus himself.

  

Safeguard of Textual Vessel: Should the physical form of this Compact be destroyed, defaced, incinerated, unraveled, or otherwise undone, the Compact shall be deemed null and void, and the obligations and privileges herein extinguished.

  

SO SWORN, SEALED, AND SIGNED, in the script of Nessus, upon parchment flayed from the hide of oathbreakers, beneath the watchful flames of Avernus, on this infernal day.
