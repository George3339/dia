# The [[Places/Avernus/Bone Brambles\|Bone Brambles]]
## Red Ruth's Lair
- It seems like Red Ruth understands Primordial 
- Why has Guts amassed such a bounty?
- She lets us know we can buy potions

- [[People and Orgs/PCs/Kyma Crimsonfate\|Kyma]] attacks and combat begins
	- [[People and Orgs/PCs/Donkus Ironbrew\|Donkus]] tries to push Red Ruth out of the way
- I collect 7 bottles (potions/sketchy elixirs)
### Red Ruth Dies
- I talk to Guts. 
	- Give me a reason not to kill you
		- We freed you
	- Do you know what it means
		- No
	- I killed a devil with it and it glowed bright red up until the moment he took his last breath
	- He's about to tell me about the amulet and he is interrupted as the spirits begin to rise
	- Where is the lamp
		- The lamp is in the hands of a devil names [[Mizora\|Mizora]]
			- She tricked Guts and ended up greeting the lamp in the prosess, same time red ruth managed to land 
	- Why did you buy the lamp in the first place
		- I thought there was a genie in it. if there is he didn't pop out
	- Why are you in the hells?
		- I haven't figured that out yet. I guess I'm trying to get back home
	- more 
		- I don't know what it is. I killed a very powerful devil who wore one 
	- Talking about who is chosen by gods
		- It's me or the wizard
			- I attract devils it's probably not good I travel with you. There's another reason I cn't be with you all. 
				- "So that's the way it's gonna be you old fart"
		- "Listen up! One of you is not an apostle. And on a separate note, heed these words: Should one day your ambition crumble and you choose sacrifice, I will be there to stop you. And in the meantime, Remember where we are and that every single thing is pure evil." Kyma feels that this gathering with Guts is something extremely rare and likely will not happen for a long time. It comes from the star in his hand
		- Are you an apostle Guts?
			- "Yeah" and he jumps off the war machine 
- We make our way to the first area we believe the place where demons spawn

# Lake of Bubbling Ichor
Tree like growths grow around a lake of black goo. Fie bearded devils are around a tree, one of them is being bullied by the others
