*A draft of my contract in hand we stand to speak with the Wizard [[Mordenkainen\|Mordenkainen]] again. Rats flow from our bag of holding as it is emptied.*

---

# RATS
- We kill the rats and [[People and Orgs/PCs/Kyma Crimsonfate\|Kyma]] picked up the deck of cards that fell out of the bag
	- Identify: there are 13 cards, when you identify it, it appears to be a deck of wonder. However, there are couple cards that are still not identified. 
	- Identify again: 1 card is from a deck of illusions and one is from a deck of many things
- When I say stop talking about pain, I instinctively clench my fist, it felt like my skin hardened for a second. 
- [[People and Orgs/PCs/Lane Wayne\|Lane]] wakes up [[People and Orgs/PCs/Bras\|Bras]] to talk about his bodily mutilation
	- After [[Places/Candlekeep\|Candlekeep]] Bras passed on information to aid in a heist in candlekeep
	- There was  rumor that a green dragon died in candlekeep with its hoard
		- They were probably looking for something within the hoard
		- Bras was the in
	- [[People and Orgs/PCs/Kyma Crimsonfate\|Kyma]] knows about the heist
		- He is not privy to tell us more
			- Who told you not to speak of this? My professor [[People and Orgs/People/Avir\|Avir]] told me not to speak of it
				- Why was he involved? With what I know this will not bring us back to Bras
## Sleep
### [[People and Orgs/PCs/Kyma Crimsonfate\|Kyma]]
You are floating in almost water, but it isn't wet. You hear this agressive folding shimering (agresive glommer sounds). As you open your eyes you see a massive glitching optical illusion, like colour and light folding in a kalidascope. There is a strong warm light from the centre that refracts off the rest of the pattern. It feels like the sun, with flares of red and green. 20 Arcana, it feels like you are observing it. He tries to call the star to him like he does with he small one, it feels like the weight of it is two much, he manages to slightly deform it before it returns to its normal shape.

## [[People and Orgs/PCs/Eamonn\|Eamonn Chrysocolla]]

I am wandering through an empty desert, it could be hell, I'm not sure. I walk from a part of sand to morse solid rock for a bit. I eventally colapse to rest and i FEEL THE HEAT AND EXHAUSTION CATCH UP TO ME. When I sit on the ground I have a thought pop into my head "What do I want?" the lamp is my answer. it feels like I'm melding into the stone and then i wake up

### [[People and Orgs/PCs/Bras\|Bras]]
You wake up in a frozen wasteland and are drawn to a small cage lit with firelight. The wind of a blizzard howls into your ear. You into the cave and see a humanoid man in tattered brown robes crouched over the fire, poking at it with a stick. Perception: 21, you see these faint dark tentacles recoil into his robe as he turns to you. "I guess you wouldn't assume that hell ould be more than a desert. Nope, hell is just where suffering endures" "Who are you?" "At this point, you're probably ondering what path to take or maybe a choice, I'm here to help you make that choice. You see, right now archdevils are plotting to take controll of [[Places/Avernus/Avernus\|Avernus]] the moment that [[People and Orgs/Deities and Beings of Power/Zariel\|Zariel]] is dealt with, there will be a power struggle. All devils want is control, there is no end to the blood war, only a change of rule, and [[Places/Avernus/Avernus\|Avernus]] is the keyhold through which the change is enacted." "Wanna throw your hat int eh ring" "No, i offer a way to break the wheel, which is why you will choose me. I am the one thing that no devil will give you, a choice,  choice to be free." "So what kind of path are you offering?" He reaches out towards [[People and Orgs/PCs/Bras\|Bras]]. "If that's all you care about, then you can have all the power you desire. I'm offering a soultion." "Which is?" one of his tentacles reaches out to Bras "Which is to cast the sword into the [[Places/Avernus/River Styx\|River Styx]] as I asked you to. All I want now if for us to agree with eachother." "Who am I agreeing with exactly?" "You're agreeing with somone who- you already know who I am" "No I don't" "I am the one, the writhing one, the one that haunts your dreams, the one who was promised to you and you are mine. Cast the sword into the Styx" 

### [[People and Orgs/PCs/Lane Wayne\|Lane]]
Lane, where do you wake up in your dream? (Self directed tour). A familiar room that he has spent a lot of time in. Lane exiting a gambling hall, enjoying the night going for a walk, pockets are filled. Lane is approached by the God of Death in his black and purple robes, the symbol dinging in his head. [[People and Orgs/Deities and Beings of Power/Kelemvor\|Kelemvor]] looks a little bit more tired than usual, bags under his eyes. "listen i have a couple more targets... I don't wanna hear it. I have too many things to do" "ready?" "The first is a powerful devil with an infernal engine for a heart, and the next is a prisoner who has lost his mind. Oh, and by the way, while you're at it, if you see the opportunity, take the sword, would you?" "if you see the chance, just take it as a piece of advice"
"Thats good advice" Lane says
Lane clarifies if he will be gaining anything from doing these targets, and Kelemvor offers him a double high five.
"Meanwhile, while you're at it, give this another shot" And he snaps his fingers and you are sent to the enormous scale
"TRY AGAIN, BALANCE IT"
- I think of the lantern, the scale does not move
- I think of Kyma, scale goes down a little, getting closer to even
- I think of Donkus
- I think of Eamonn
- I think of Bras
- I think of Paladin danse
- It goes down and levels
- we stare at the embodyment of evil in front of us, as we do we get tunnel vision, forgetting who is next to us. 
	- Before you can look around the scale shakes and [[People and Orgs/Deities and Beings of Power/Kelemvor\|Kelemvor]] goes "So close"

### Scrying on [[Mizora\|Mizora]]
I see [[Mizora\|Mizora]] walking through a hallway. As she comes to a room and opens the door. In the room there is A crystal ball on a table and a hole in the wall for a window. Outside I can see what looks like avernus. She notices the sensor orb. She chuckles and smiles. "I'd really rather save that spell." She leans over the table and attempts to dispel the scrying and succeeds. 

- Identify the Secret Juice
	- It's weird but strong

### Scrying on [[People and Orgs/PCs/Kyma Crimsonfate\|Kyma]]'s Dad
I see him lying in shackles at the bottom of a cell wearing nothing but worn prisoners clothes, theres dirt and dried blood on him. I can barely see his face through all the filth.  The ground feels tilted Out the window I see some smoke and it looks like th interior of some sort of structure, but from the wind blowing it seems open or half destroyed, not sure if I'm inside or outside. I do not see the magic carpet or the wizard hat. i hear faint squelching sounds and pittering on the ground. 

# Across the lake
