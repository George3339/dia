*Maggie brings us in a circle. "Hold hands please, just relax, let the magic take you into sleep." Maggie casts her spell and the magic swells around us. We feel our eyes get heavy. As we close our eyes we see a light that grows and grows. We feel a pull, drawn to something. As the rich radiant light of 100 dancing rainbows dissolves we see Lulu with a [[People and Orgs/Deities and Beings of Power/Zariel\|blindfolded angel]]. "I haven't done this in a while. This only shows what Lulu wishes to be true, push further." We push through. The first dream fades and the next engulfs us in flames, we are in a battlefield, in the centre, an angel and Lulu are unconscious and we are protecting them, six spine devils surround us. A formation of retreating human warriors "The devils, you must defeat the devils."*

# Lulu's Dreams
## An Ambush of Devils 
Six spine devils surround us, human warriors retreat into a portal.  

## A landscape of death and decay
The creatures we just killed kneel before us and swear they will serve us if we spare them

## A Vast Barren Landscape
We wander trough. Black sludge spurts from the ground, we feel loss. [[People and Orgs/PCs/Lane Wayne\|Lane]] gets stuck.

## The Last Dream
[[People and Orgs/People/Lulu\|Lulu]] is resting on a black cushion at the centre of an inky void. A beam of light shines down on her. A spyglass sits on a tripod. Lulu wakes us and sees it. She looks into it an looks back and cries out! "The sword the sword I know where it is!!"

# Fort Knucklebone

Lulu: "I saw the hill, where it all happened."

# Ambush of Pain
At night we see [[People and Orgs/Deities and Beings of Power/Devil of Pain\|Pain]]. He doesn't have clothes on and he looks covered in blood. He's holding [[People and Orgs/People/Lulu\|Lulu]] with a knife to her jugular. "It seemed so obvious but it isn't"
- "I thought I was only going to do this with a few of you. I'm glad I got your names. Forced contract. You first Eamon"
	- I start to take damage when he does
	- I feel a tug, like my essence is being squeezed, and as [[People and Orgs/PCs/Donkus Ironbrew\|Donkus]] kills pain it's like the grip tightens before releasing.

[[People and Orgs/PCs/Kyma Crimsonfate\|Kyma]] send a sending 
Hello, bad times in Avernus, research the pain devil. Forced a contract on us, outsource collaborate, ask around. Pain is deadly.

Not fully, understanding. Reminder, contracts require mediums, destroy medium. Contact with your father, also difficult. Having trouble reaching the plane. Serious divine forces meddling with Avernus. 

Insight on the binding of the contract 20: Pain struggled against the acid to get his hands together. His form may be the contract medium?

# Dream
I'm wandering a desert, it could be home, it could be Avernus. It's like I'm living through a moment, I can't pinpoint it but it feels like I'm doing something important. Like the walk I'm doing will change something significantly. I come into a more enclosed rocky area. It gets dark and I start to feel bad, I feel guilty for a weird reason. Some lights start to dance around me and as they do I see Donkus is dead, cut open on the ground. The lights continue to circle as I see my friends dead around my feet. And then I have a thought, it's coming from me but I don't know why I have it, "They're all dead and its my fault". I go to check my belongings, I don't have everything, wait no, I have the amulet. 

# The Next Day

## Maggie's Gifts
- She wants us to succeed 
- She offers to give us a war machine 
- She gives Kyma a spell scroll of Bigby's hand
- She gives us a [[Magic Items not owned/Bag of Holding\|Bag of Holding]]
	- Be careful with that, I left it out and a bunch of rats went missing

- Chuku and Clonk hand us 3 soul coins
