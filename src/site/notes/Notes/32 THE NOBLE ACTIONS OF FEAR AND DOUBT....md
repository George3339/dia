# A watchtower on the Styx
behind the tower is a large wooden crane with a winch and a boat by the tower. There is a good spread of Devils at the base of the tower
- It looks like a collection of 4 bearded devils and 4 hellhounds
- As we attack them there is a chain devil and a Amin
Inside the first floor there is a stone altar and weapons and armour on the wall
The second floor is strewn with hooked chains and a spiked iron chair is bolted to the floor. There is a dead figure in one of the hanging cages in the room. There is a sickle gleaming next to the corpse.
