# In the Tower of [[People and Orgs/Mordenkainen\|Mordenkainen]]


- "The weave, t's not what you think, its not alive it's more like life itself. It is like water. It is life but it is everything. All magic comes from it, and all magi returns to it, like water all that touches it returns to it. It can be contaminated, tainted. No amount of conam would change it, but now because the plane has been slowly sealed off it's like pressure building. There is less water in the dam and so it gets contaminated more easily. I don't know what's causing these changes (he looks at [[People and Orgs/PCs/Kyma Crimsonfate\|Kyma]]'s eyes). And then there is [[People and Orgs/Deities and Beings of Power/Mystra\|Mystra]]. I can't contact her, she would know what's going on, or at least have an idea, as the weave is her responsibility."
	- "How would a deity be contacting someone on this plane if it's cut off?"
		- It's not cut off yet. It could depend on the- well, the um, potency of the magic could be a factor. Do you think your friends are casting at a high enough level. I've made stretches, it's been a day, gods. 
	- "Can I know what you're doing with my toe"
		-  "I needed flesh, a spell component, it could not be me."
	- "Have you seen a wizard on a magic carpet"
		- "I have. It's been a few days. He was searching for a way to free the companion"
			- Did he mention anything about daemon contracts?
				- "Not exactly. He did as me something- as far a s I know daemons don't make contracts. He asked me if I believed a daemon would keep it's word."
					- We ask about Pain breaking the rules of contracts
						- He looks confused for a second. "[[People and Orgs/Deities and Beings of Power/Zariel\|Zariel]]'s rules? Contracts work how they work, I'm not sure what she has to do with it. A forced contract should not be possible, unless... unless the rules were broken"
						- When he said the alternative was impossible, he was thinking about something other than the contract was forced upon us. 
							- I ask about this
								- He goes over and flips through a book "For the rules to change this devil would have received favouritism from the Lord of Nessus himself" He won't tell us more about this. 
								- "Who is this, how would they get this favour"
									- It is theorized that [[People and Orgs/Deities and Beings of Power/Azmodeus\|Azmodeus]] can alter any contract that exists at will, and that would imply that he can change the nature of contracts. but if he were to do this it would be extremely taboo and cause other archdevils to question his position, that's a joke. 
	- Do you know anything about devil's talisman. Can it be created or only found? Can it be created against a devil's will?
		- They are tricky, it's rare for a devil to have one, and if they do it's usually protected beyond any sort of reason. They can be created yes, but not if a devil already has one. I'm not sure if you would require the true name of the devil. 
		- "To cut to the chase, I've been working on a spell to summon pain, bu having his talisman would aid"
- [[People and Orgs/PCs/Lane Wayne\|Lane]] asks for magic items and he is given a scroll of find steed
	- We give him a scroll of life transference for 2 150 gp 
	- [[People and Orgs/PCs/Donkus Ironbrew\|Donkus]] pulls out some spice and [[People and Orgs/Mordenkainen\|Mordenkainen]] seemed interested
	- Lane begins to try and negotiate with morty
		- We are handed an elixir of health
	- He also shows us some books of holy halfsetp
- "If I don't ask you this question my friend will kill me. She told me before I left you had a lost spell, your last spell."
	- I've made many spells, I'm not sure what she could be referring to
		- Donkus, 24 insight: It seemed like he had a solid idea forming in his head as he went to answer and then he thought through a couple things. When he answered it was like he was actually not sure what to respond. 
- We pay him one soul coin for the boots of holy half step

## Outside the Tower

- I take 3 of the beans increasing str by 2 and int by 1 (for 11, and 11)
- I tell the party I am planning on trading the helm of torm for the genie lamp
	- they are in less opposition then I believed they would be
- Kyma show me his memory of the magic exiting the ground as he casts a spell near the giant wasp nest
	- He also shows me a dream. I get a slightly pleasent feeling like being eveloped wituh warm water. As the eyes open I am inside a magical soup, like being encased in the weave. I see Kyma try to cast a spell, draw from the magic and it fails as the dream ends. 
### Fey Appears in Front of Us
- After their conversation [[People and Orgs/PCs/Bras\|Bras]] has another rune in infernal on his back
### [[Paladin Danse\|Paladin Danse]]
- He looked at the map  and then gave a little fairwell to us with a prayer is thing to torm.

## While we Rest
- Lane confronts Bras about the eyeball on his chest
	- He shows us the tentacles climbing up his body and the eye on his chest.
	- This has been aflicting me since long before I met all of you. It' gotten significantly worse when we entered the hells

### Making A Deal
- I call out over the boiling lake of blood "[[People and Orgs/Mizora\|Mizora]], Servant of Zariel, I call upon you to make a deal"
	- She appears before I can finish my sentence 
	- She has no interest in the helm of torm
	- She is offering the temporary safety of my family and my freedom in both forces
		- She will ask things of me, favours, but nothing too drastic
			- My companions might be a slight issue, but she won't have me do anything that will cause a falling out
	- What about my connection to Sunnis
		- I wouldn't worry about that, you can worship who you'd like
