# Wandering Emporium
## Mistress Miranda 
- About [[People and Orgs/Deities and Beings of Power/Devil of Pain\|Pain]]'s contract ability
	- That's odd. It sort of breaks the rules, the non consensual aspect of it
## Paladin of Tyr
[[People and Orgs/People/Paladin Danse\|Paladin Danse]] 
- He is searching for a way to break the chains
- Locations he points out
	- [[People and Orgs/Deities and Beings of Power/Bell\|Bell]]'s Forge
	- Dragon or two coming from the skull thing at the top left
	- I don't know what the floating things are
- He's also sensed some magical chatter cluttering the air, similar to the sending interference
	- It's possible the devils have a telapathic sort of network
- As I'm showing him lacations it seems like valuable info to him
- About my neclace
	- That is an odd trinket, quite countering to your ensemble

# Ambush
- Loot
	- 2 soul coins
	- 86 gold
	- Spellbook
	- 1 Spell scroll
	- Magic cloak
		- glamourweave cloak
	- Splint armour 
- Speak with dead
	- Who were you?
		- My name was [[Victor\|Victor]]
	- What is your relation to [[People and Orgs/Deities and Beings of Power/Kelemvor\|Kelemvor]]?
		- None whatsoever
	- Who did you serve in life
		- I serve the archduchess [[People and Orgs/Deities and Beings of Power/Zariel\|Zariel]]
	- What do you now about magic condensing in the hells?
		- Only has such level of magic been present in one place a handfull of times in the last several millenia, it can cause a straining to the weave. 
	- What was your mission for Zariel?
		- Prevent archon the cruel from completing his goal (pauses between his words as he says this)


# Across the Styx
- The war machine is still there
	- There is a humanoid guy. He has green skin and it looks like tree roots as hair. He has some modded armour and a bunch of misc gear
	- "The smiler has always got to stay on move."
	- He tells us there's rain coming and pisses
	- He's off to take down a war machine and then notes that another is Zariel's
	- "Lots of wizards out now. Things are happening."
	- He sprouts black feathered wings and flies off
