- [[People and Orgs/People/Jander Sunstar\|Jander Sunstar]] is killed by  lightning bolt from [[People and Orgs/PCs/Donkus Ironbrew\|Donkus]]' wand of wonder
	- His last words are "I'm never leaving this place"
- We run from [[Places/Haruman's Hill\|Haruman's Hill]]

# Resting
- I try to cast speak with dead on the ashes but it doesn't work
- I minor illusion Kelemvor's symbol
	- It's a very obscure god of death
	- Besides the dead three there are other gods of death
		- He is above the dead three
- Detect thaughts on [[People and Orgs/PCs/Lane Wayne\|Lane]]
	- Surface: Worry, [[People and Orgs/PCs/Eamonn\|People and Orgs/PCs/Eamonn]] is gonna try and kill me
- [[People and Orgs/PCs/Donkus Ironbrew\|Donkus]] comes up to me visibly having cried and says "He had to die right? It's what Rodg would have wanted right?"
- [[People and Orgs/PCs/Bras\|Bras]] sits me and Kyma down, 
	- I go first "Do I pick a card?/ no the card picks you."
		- He flips over a card, the mirage. This can mean upheaval or broken pride. 
	- Kyma picks the helm, but reversed. This one also maybe is late but means losing control or clinging to it too strongly, or even pure bad luck. 
	- I get another card. The drunk, reversed. Could represent carelessness or apathy, potentially about our situation or relationships
	- [[People and Orgs/People/Lulu\|Lulu]] asks to have her card read. The sails. Direction, control, or even willpower. 
- [[People and Orgs/People/Lulu\|Lulu]] adresses all of us
	- I was confident about the hill because I was looking at it and remebered it to be very important for some reason. 
	- There are like two other places that could be leads. 
		- One was a place where demons were spawning. 
		- Another was a place where demons were being destroyed
- [[People and Orgs/PCs/Kyma Crimsonfate\|Kyma]] asks Lane if he's met his father. 
	- When we saw him I had seen him before. I had a vision. I had seen him in dreams
	- Did you have a vision of him dying? 
	- I had seen him in a dream, I wish I could explain everything but I can't. And I need you to be okay with that for a while. I can't talk about this right now. 
		- I'm giving you a few days to process this 
- Some imps aproach the hut. I make it look like a rock. They leave when the see the [[Places/Wandering Emporium\|Wandering Emporium]]
## Dream
- I'm thinking about the clay mouth. I'm working with the clay. 
- The mouth goes RUS VISK ROTUND, SHARP SOOUD. Then in makes intensifying grunting sounds says "well done" and then smiles

## Wake up
- Remind Denver to tell me something before next session. 
- Not too far in the distance we see a stationary caravan of war machines, some tents and tables. And a big sign that says [[Places/Wandering Emporium\|Wandering Emporium]], underneath that it says no killing of fighting, enforced by killing and fighting.
- In the emporium we see a man greet us. "Welcome first time customers. I am your humble host [[People and Orgs/People/Mahadi\|Mahadi]]. Make yourselves comfortable. This is a neural territory for the war."
- We stroll into the wandering emporium and Bras sees someone he knows she approaches him in demonic form "Baby!!"
