*We have spilled the blood of [[People and Orgs/Deities and Beings of Power/Tiamat\|Tiamat]] and in doing so made an enemy of [[People and Orgs/Arkan the Cruel\|Arkan the Cruel]]. Now we push on to ultimately get an audience with [[People and Orgs/Deities and Beings of Power/Bel\|Bel]]

# The Escape
- We ask [[People and Orgs/Deities and Beings of Power/Garguth\|Garguth]] how to get to the Titan
- An indecernable amount of time passes but it feels brief
	- We get to the [[Places/Avernus/River Styx\|River Styx]], there is a ramp
		- [[People and Orgs/PCs/Eamonn\|Eamonn]] uses wall of stone to bridge over the styx
- Very far away there are massive wings flapping upwards. [[People and Orgs/PCs/Lane Wayne\|Lane]] notices a small singular bike trailing us far away. 
- There seems to be more traffic around us
- There is a war party moving towards us
	- "Word travel's pretty fast when an apostle get's angry"
	- [[People and Orgs/PCs/Bras\|Bras]] charms them with the rod of rulership and they pull away
-  Chum bucket says: Legend sais [[People and Orgs/Bitterbreath\|Bitterbreath]] wronged [[People and Orgs/Deities and Beings of Power/Zariel\|Zariel]] and she curse him to never be able to make a deal again
- I use the robe of stars to go to the astral plane
	- In the astral it's like a roalercauster of the cosmos
	- In the distance is drakness and light in various forms
	- My whole body feels heavy and tight, there's lights that flicker and a red mist pulses through the stars beneath 
- We seem to have shaken [[Obitala\|Obitala]] 
- We see [[People and Orgs/PCs/Kyma Crimsonfate\|Kyma]]'s father flying overhead'
	- I scry his cell, he is there 
	- I fly up to him
		- It looks like Mordenkanen
			- I see he is covered in illuion magic and the carpet is magical the hat is non-magical. He has various magic items as well
			- "It's crazy what a little diquse spell and a reputation can get you in this place"
				- He is revealed to be an evil looking wizard with glowing golden eyes and devil claws and teeth
					- "I thought we could share the light, I thought there could be space for us two mages, but then your friend had to make a clever deal. For what it's worth Kyma, I was going to let you live just to see what would happen."
	- He runs
- Kyma is crying, his tears are magical 
- There is some disscussion about who's "deal" caused this

# An Angelic Creature
A large humanoid winged creature approaches us with speed. He stops in front of us suddenly. An Empyrean. "My freinds I have found you finally. I thnk you all for restoring my form. I am [[People and Orgs/Uldrach\|Uldrach]] and I stand before you humbly and am in your service. There is a dragon pursuing you please be wary of this threat"
- He gives us his blood
- He tries to teleport away and Kyma sees something as the plane shift fails
- Do you know anything about the companion
	- No
