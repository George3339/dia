Where we left off... We rescued the Grand Duke from death and defeat at the hands of a portal. We had an encounter with the [[People and Orgs/Deities and Beings of Power/Devil of Pain\|Devil of Pain]]. We are not trying to return the Duke from the state the [[Magic Items not owned/Helm of Torm\|Helm of Torm]] has left him in. We are about to perform a ritual of returning to remove the influence of the helm. 
# A Ritual of Return
- [[People and Orgs/People/Feria\|Feria]] performs the ritual
- [[People and Orgs/People/Celturn\|Celturn]] observes the ritual
- Feria begins the ritual
	- [[People and Orgs/PCs/Donkus Ironbrew\|Donkus]] prays to [[People and Orgs/Deities and Beings of Power/Chauntea\|Chauntea]]
		- Some leaves settle near the [[People and Orgs/People/Ulder Ravenguard\|Ulder Ravenguard]] and he settles slightly
		- Moss grows at his feet
	- "Whatever happens don't let my concentration break"
	- Feria places the sword on top of the Grand Duke and begins a prayer to [[People and Orgs/Deities and Beings of Power/Torm\|Torm]]
	- Magic begins to swell around the altar
	- A few minutes into the ritual, she says 'Torm the true cleanse this helmet, Torm the true show us your power and cleanse this helmet of demonic power.'
		- As she does, the grand duke struggles and writhes, he briefly escapes our grasp. 
		- Two lights burst out of the helmet and swirl around him. 
			- The two will 'o whisps die
- The ritual is a success.
	- There was a moment the helmet was void of magic but then it came back
	- The Duke wakes up
		- "I was having like a dream. There were people fighting for my consciousness. I saw things. There was a woman in armour, angelic, with a long sword. Next to her there was some sort of flying elephant. There was also a big demon, threatening to kill and devour the woman. Something that looked like [[People and Orgs/People/Lulu\|Lulu]] made a trumpet sound and the demon was flung away. And then a large palace erupted around a sword of some kind, and the scab, flesh began to engulfed the palace and the elephant flew off. The Demon was engulfed with the palace, and then. There were two bird people in weird armour, black birds. Strange machines, some sort of big metal tool."
			- [[People and Orgs/People/Lulu\|Lulu]] reacts. She remembers the two bird people, they were her friends. "There was a fort. The names of the bird people were [[People and Orgs/People/Chukka\|Chukka]] and [[People and Orgs/People/Clonka\|Clonka]]." "There's the fort! They helped me get out. [[Places/Avernus/Fort Knucklebone\|Fort Knucklebone]] is the name of the fort."
- Lulu asks if we are friends and when we answer yes we are all blessed

# A Rest
- [[People and Orgs/PCs/Lane Wayne\|Lane]] is confronted about his racism
	- Dwarves create weapons 
- I cast identify on the evil stone
	- As i touch it, I am overcome with a vision. Flashes of the wasteland of hell below me, flame and brimstone, darkness. I see large machines. I start to move fast through the terrain of hell. I see a large black canyon with tree branches pushing through the side of the stone. Deeper down a black wall of stone. In the corner of the end of the canyon I see a gaping hole in the ground covered in dark black vines. I start to descend into the hole, I feel the aura of the stone flowing. I reach the darkness at the tip of hell. I see a dark sarcophagus flowing with a magic that is  purely evil and dark. The only thought that comes to mind is, what sort of dark power could reside within this sarcophagus. 
	- This is a fragment of something stronger, of the sarcophagus. It's a way of finding it. It was changed and altered by a wish.
- I learn that [[People and Orgs/People/Guts\|Guts]] passed through [[Places/Eltaurel/High Hall\|High Hall]] walked down the chains. He had one eye closed. He probably descended one of the nearby chains
-  Bras begins to play the lute and we are compelled to toss him a coin
## Sleep
I dream. I seem to be in a memory. Thoughts come to me in my mind, it's unclear if they are mine or someone else's, but they are mine. I am a slave. I've been a slave my whole life, and part of me knows that's just how it is. I was dealt a bad hand. Part of me knows I want something more, wether it's freedom or ambition, or both. 

I am running through a small town in the desert as a child. There's a big castle in the distance. It's grand and majestic and is everything I don't have. The things I want and desire, power, influence, respect. The castle is what draws my vision. An old lady stops me, "Slow down there son" "Tell me, I'm sort of a seer, " at this her voice seems weird "What is your dream?" "I would offer you this trinket I suppose. Very few boys are so aware of their situation." She hands me the crimson amulet I carry "Now keep that, it's important, and it's yours. One day, when you find the ambition within yourself to seize that power, you will be granted an opportunity." What is your name? "I am no one, but I suppose my name in your tongue would just be the letter A"
