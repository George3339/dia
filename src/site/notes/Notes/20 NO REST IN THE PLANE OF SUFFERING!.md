*A magic orb consumed. A river to cross. There is potential in the distance but danger there too.*

# A Small Tower by The Styx
The War machine rolls up and near the front we see a goblin with some advanced armour and clothes. He is sweeping outside the tower
- We talk to the goblin, he has a boat, his name is [[People and Orgs/People/Eclipse\|Eclipse]]
	- 4 soul coins (one per person)
	- He has had an affinity to travel the realms. He's here because of a wizard and a gem
- I ask Kyma about the stone
	- I felt compelled and I crushed 
- We haggle to two soul coins
- 26 Performance to hide the war machine 

# Across the Styx
- I collect a vial of the river styx
	- A ghostly hand pulls up at the vial and I hear a cry that sounds like the cry of the workers at the mines in my past life
- In the distance we will see the [[Forge of Bell\|Forge of Bell]]
	- Bell is the former leader of [[Places/Avernus/Avernus\|Avernus]]
		- He might hate [[People and Orgs/Deities and Beings of Power/Zariel\|Zariel]]
		- He is the second in command 
- We make our way to [[Places/Avernus/Haruman's Hill\|Haruman's Hill]]

# Haruman's Hill
- I eat another magic pear
	- For the next two hours I can cast detect thaughts at will
		- I cast it on Lane
			- Surface: Hatred and rage for me. A pleasure and desire to fuck with [[People and Orgs/PCs/Donkus Ironbrew\|Donkus]]
	- Deeper: I have a love of fucking with Donkus, it is now a passion. You feel an unbridled rage for me because I tried to kill him 4 times. I feel a 5.5/10 worry associated to an image of a skeleton hand holding a scale, I sense that Lane is looking for some sort of balance. At one point or another. I also get a flash of a wizard's hat. 

Iron wrought gates
- There are knights impaled on the iron trees
	- They are kept alive by some magic
- I detect thaughts Kyma
	- Surface Level: I just saw my dad that's heavy, I should cast sending soon. Why. I l knwo how this spell works, is it the same, i only know of one person who wears a wizard hat.

The night at the top of the hill is awake, being eaten live by the Sturges that surround him
- Who would risk so much to speak to a forsaken soul such as mine 
- I cannot drink such things (water) I am eternally cursed
- Detect taughts
	- Surface: I wish I could die. Most of his surface thoughts are plagued by his desire to end his suffering. He thinks a-lot about his pain and wallowing the past. He thinks about a battle. 
	- What do you know of the [[Magic Items not owned/Sword of Zariel\|Sword of Zariel]]?
		- Zariel's weapon was powerful, formidible and seccond to no devil and demon in her path. She had it when I left.
		- Do you see her sword here?
		- Surface: I chose this, it was the only way to attone for my sins. If only to give the years in hopes that Lethander's mercy will reach me one day.
		- I can be the one who leads you to it. 
			- I was thinking that his mercy would come with my death, but perhaps this is the way I should repay my sins. There seems to be no other path but forward. But he will cme for me
			- ZARIEL HAS CONDEMNED ME BUT IF YOU WERE TO FREE ME I COULD REPAY THE DEBT. LET ME GO BEFORE SHE FINDS OUT. BEFORE HE SEES US.
				- Probing: I see a large flaming black knight steed looming in his mine and a strong purpose to redeem himself by leading us to the sword. 
- He seems to be vampiric
- I look to [[People and Orgs/People/Lulu\|Lulu]] 
- The Narzukan pears as we take him off the tree
	- Donkus takes a step back wounded. In that moment we hear a call for help
		- "GUYS" we see Lulu is being dragged by a wasp like creature. Not too far off we see a large hive like structure tied to the plane by devlish chains. Angelic figures stuck and strung to the papery flesh of the masife wasps nest.
	- As [[People and Orgs/PCs/Lane Wayne\|Lane Wayne]] hits the Narzukan a small iron tree spouts at Lane's feet. His name is carved in the sprout "Crime assaulting an officer".
