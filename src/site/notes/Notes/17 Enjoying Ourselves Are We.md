# Fort Knucklebones 
- The fort looks like a hand
## Fort Gate
- Two redcaps meet us and we force them to let us through
## Inside the fort
- There are a few vehicles 
- We see [[People and Orgs/People/Clonka\|Clonka]] and [[People and Orgs/People/Chukka\|Chukka]]
	- They run off to get the boss
		- She is a hag
			- Her name is [[People and Orgs/People/Mad Maggie\|Mad Maggie]]
			- She has an abomination of demon parts as a bodyguard [[People and Orgs/People/Mickey\|Mickey]] 
		- Maggie is on neutral terms with us
		- There are other things in this fort
		- She has it in her to be friendly if she likes us 
- We talk to The kenku
	- War! Memories gone
		- It seems they don't know what happened 
	- 'Can't keep the boss waiting'
	- 'The Boss is strong, the boss does magic'
	- Does the boss serve [[People and Orgs/Deities and Beings of Power/Zariel\|Zariel]]?
		- "Come with me Birdies" "I know of a place safe from the Blood War" "A safe place in hell"
- We inspect the war machine
	- There's a gear in the wrong place
	- One of the Kenku offers me a hit of 'spice' 
- Inside the fort proper we see an alchemy jug in the corner, and some stuff laid out on a table that's tied down; A nice looking rapier and some armour and some wands, and a loose piece of parchment with soul coin costs.
- The imps tell us that [[People and Orgs/People/Wazik\|Wazik]] the redcap wants to kill Lulu, tells us to kill him
	- They'll give us a cursed ring or wishes
- Ask about [[People and Orgs/People/Lulu\|Lulu]]'s memories
	- She came by here before, her memories were scattred, closer to the incident, like her psyche was being destroyed.
	- There's something I could do. I'm particularly proficient in dealing with a certain type of magic. And well dreams are a pathway to many memories. If you would so be inclined I could take us into Lulu's dreams. But you have to tell me why you're here and you have to spend the night
	- I tell her we are trying to save [[Places/Eltaurel/Elturel\|Elturel]].
		- She seems amused, but she knows we are here for so much more
- Why are we here
	- "I can't understand the minds of beings much large than myself, but I've gotten a sense for a while now, well, I have seen omens. Omens of the future, omens of what is to come. The end, the end of this place, the end of the blood war, the end of my home. I've accepted that, but well, I'm not sure how it will all go down." As she speaks we see the sky begin to change, forming the symbol of [[People and Orgs/Deities and Beings of Power/Bhaal\|Bhaal]], and then banging, as if he is banging on the plane himself. Two sentences in deep speech are spoken from the sky. 
	- "try to mind yourself, who's destiny is it you are fulfilling. "
## The Dream Journey
*Maggie brings us in a circle. "Hold hands please, just relax, let the magic take you into sleep." Maggie casts her spell and the magic swells around us. We feel our eyes get heavy. As we close our eyes we see a light that grows and grows. We feel a pull, drawn to something. As the rich radiant light of 100 dancing rainbows dissolves we see Lulu with a [[People and Orgs/Deities and Beings of Power/Zariel\|blindfolded angel]]. "I haven't done this in a while. This only shows what Lulu wishes to be true, push further." We push through. The first dream fades and the next engulfs us in flames, we are in a battlefield, in the centre, an angel and Lulu are unconscious and we are protecting them, six spine devils surround us. A formation of retreating human warriors "The devils, you must defeat the devils."*
