# A Deal at the Crossroads

An imp is trying to make a deal with [[People and Orgs/People/Harkna\|Harkna]]
- [[People and Orgs/People/Redscar\|Redscar]] is the imp making the deal, he is saying he can bring back her son
	- It would be rare for an imp to be able to bring someone to life
We continue to press on to [[Places/Eltaurel/High Hall\|High Hall]]
- I go to cast speak with dead on Harkna's son's corpse but a geyser of flame erupts and burns his body
We approach [[Places/Eltaurel/Torm's Bridge\|Torm's Bridge]]
- A rift in the earth splits [[Places/Eltaurel/Elturel\|Elturel]]
- A bridge 20 ft wide spans the chasm, holy wards on the bridge have been etched onto the bridge 
	- It has been consecrated to the god [[People and Orgs/Deities and Beings of Power/Torm\|Torm]]
	- The runes on the bridge aren't active
	- The devils look like spine devils and 
- A small pale devilish creature climbs out of a sewer grate nearby. 
	- "I'm the [[People and Orgs/Deities and Beings of Power/Devil of Pain\|Devil of Pain]]. And I have come to inflict it upon you for eternity"
	- [[People and Orgs/PCs/Kyma Crimsonfate\|Kyma]] burns it dead with acid
- We try and get through by pretending to be people who's souls have been signed away
- I pretend to trip to touch the bridge
	- I recall a simple prayer to [[People and Orgs/Deities and Beings of Power/Torm\|Torm]], one that I heard [[People and Orgs/People/Reya\|Reya]] use
		- I speak it
			- The bridge runes light up as it is activated 
				- As I activate the bridge, two of the spine devils are burned to death
			- I pick up a coin that one of the devil's dropped
				- (Maybe a soul coin)
## Towards High Hall
- The 'Devil of Pain' appears again, both his hands turn to daggers 
	- I kill it with an eldritch blast
- As we turn around the corner Lulu scouts and comes back hiding
	- "There's something guarding high hall"
	- It's like a flame deamon
		- it's a Narzugan
	- We try and sneak past the guard of devils guarding High Hall
- Short rest
	- Detect magic on the coin: Necrotic. I identify some magical aura of a soul
	- As we are ready to leave Lulu tells us there's someone outside
		- There's an ethereal weak sort of footsteps outside
			- There seem too be a couple undead outside
	- There are two hellhounds patrolling the door 
### The Run to Safety
- I make the mother and son invisible
- We meet a man who joins us to High Hall, he seems shifty
- [[People and Orgs/PCs/Donkus Ironbrew\|Donkus]] creates a wall of fire with the [[Magic Items not owned/Shield of Garguth\|Shield of Garguth]] as a smokescreen
	- Many of the undead die to the wall of fire
- We all run to safety, the Narzugan can't seem to enter High Hall, or at least the Nightmare refuses to
-
