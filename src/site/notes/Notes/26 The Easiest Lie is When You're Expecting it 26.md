*At the mouth to the [[Bone Brambles\|Bone Brambles]] forest we prepare to find [[People and Orgs/People/Red Ruth\|Red Ruth]]*

After [[People and Orgs/PCs/Kyma Crimsonfate\|Kyma]] creates a new spell he exudes a blue goo and his skin becomes more blue #Kyma_Tranformation 

# The Bone Brambles
In the distance we hear a man call out like a cornered animal. In the distance a flying fortress has an explosion and it begins to fall from the sky. 
A few devils are overheard talking
 - "yeah it was so weird, he called himself the devil of pain and said he would inflict it on us for an eternity. He could have ended us but he just left"
 - We kill them, two have a soul coin and all three have a vial of demon ichor. 
Speak with dead
- What direction to [[People and Orgs/People/Red Ruth\|Red Ruth]]?
	- At the centre of the forest
- Are there traps on the way?
	- I don't know
- When did you last see the [[People and Orgs/Deities and Beings of Power/Devil of Pain\|Devil of Pain]]
	- I don't know, a day of two I don't keep track of time
- Who's side os Red Ruth on
	- She's on her own side
- What bodily modifications did the [[People and Orgs/Deities and Beings of Power/Devil of Pain\|Devil of Pain]] have?
	- Only what he could modify of his own body. He could change his shape at will. 

When i say I don't think it's her (relating to Sunnis and the amulet) it's like I felt an earthquake but no one seems to notice it. I get the sense of hope, what if I'm wrong. 

Kyma begins to hear, perfect speaks 
"It's working! It's working. Listen, we lost contact with your father yesterday, something is wrong with communicating with the plane. Something is blocking comms. We can't teleport, we can't send messages. We tried everything, we made a new spell for this, you need to find-!!"
- Kyma tries to respond, "Too much magic concentrated in the hells."
We tell Kyma about what is said to happen if he talks to his dad
A light flies out of Kyma's sleeve 
- Casting detect magic reveals it to be a part of every type of magic
Kyma sends a message to his father

[[People and Orgs/PCs/Lane Wayne\|Lane]] confronts [[People and Orgs/PCs/Bras\|Bras]] about what he overheard at the [[Places/Wandering Emporium\|Wandering Emporium]]
- The book Bras took from [[Places/Candlekeep\|Candlekeep]] was one which delved into the supernatural relationship between gods and death and the hells.
- I've had a feeling that my fate is predetermined

There is a body in the maze of thorns


## The Centre of The Brambles
### Guts
-  "Where is the lamp?"
	- "Let me go and I'll tell you"
- "Did you free what was inside"
	- "No it's fine, you're going to have to free me though"
- He is wearing an amulet like mind but tit is dark green
### Red Ruth
- [[People and Orgs/People/Red Ruth\|Red Ruth]] "Assuming your friend stays his hand and does not free my prisoner, I'd ask that you hold the fort while I take my bath." 
- [[People and Orgs/Deities and Beings of Power/Devil of Pain\|Pain]] is breaking [[People and Orgs/Deities and Beings of Power/Zariel\|Zariel]]'s rules, Red Ruth seemed outraged by the concept
- She blurts out "Do you not have fiends in your party, one that can hear him"  seemingly referring to a voice in her head
	- We know there is something up with magical communication in [[Places/Avernus\|Avernus]], maybe she is hearing some of it.
- If he is freed or rested or healed or gone, then you will all be indebted to me a fortune of soul coins. 

#### Plan??
- Free and rest Guts
- Major image Guts still restrained. 
- Profit?
