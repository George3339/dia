# [[People and Orgs/Deities and Beings of Power/Devil of Pain\|Pain]]'s Escape
- We run over pain for one more time.
- As I feel the pain damage shoot into y soul it is too mcuh to bear. I feel my heart beat, it's like for a moment, like my muscles are tearing and regenerating i instant. It feels like I'm being torn to a million peices. I see pain getting hit by the wheels and it's like his eyes widen and he looks at me as I fall unconscious. 
- Behind us pain is dead, his corpse torn up and mangled
- I pick up the amulet and I feel stoneskin cast on me. I can now cast stoneskin once per day.
- [[People and Orgs/PCs/Lane Wayne\|Lane]] empties Pain's backpack
	- A large belt
		- Belt of Fire Giant Strength with a curse that paralizes you 
	- 2 spell scrolls
		- Disguise self
		- Shield
	- 2 potions
		- potion of speed
		- greater healing 
	- 1 smokepowder bomb 

# Return to the [[Places/Avernus/Wandering Emporium\|Wandering Emporium]]
- The golden devil aproaches [[People and Orgs/PCs/Lane Wayne\|Lane]], he introduces himself as Chronos
- [[People and Orgs/PCs/Kyma Crimsonfate\|Kyma]] asks [[People and Orgs/People/Mahadi\|Mahadi]] how much the decursing for [[People and Orgs/Deities and Beings of Power/Devil of Pain\|Devil of Pain]]'s ring was. 
- After resting I put the memory of going unconcious while pain dies
	- [[People and Orgs/PCs/Kyma Crimsonfate\|Kyma]] watches the memory. Pain is blissfull and joyfull as he is run over, as [[People and Orgs/PCs/Eamonn\|Eamonn]] is going down. It's like he has achieved something, and he is so particularly happy it was Eamonn.
# Back on the road
- As we drive we see a cloud of purple mist. It pulses with electricity and sits above a hole in the ground. 
- We pass a massive tower in the distance. Our repair golem notes that we could sleep there
	- A black tower looms in the horizon, there are charred skulls wion pikes. 
	- Circling the tower's peak is a white dragon circling, 
- We all hear a dink in the war machine, we hear another. Someone is shooting us, [[People and Orgs/PCs/Donkus Ironbrew\|Donkus]] gets hit and we seek refuge under a rock where [[People and Orgs/PCs/Eamonn\|Eamonn]] creates a wall of stone to protect us.

# Resting Under the Rock
- We talk about family and relationships
- Bras has heard of the [[House of Hope\|House of Hope]], it might have brothels in it.
	- It's somewhere in avernus and it's run by a powerful devil
- As we lay to sleep, [[People and Orgs/PCs/Lane Wayne\|Lane]] creates an image of the stars over our head
- Casting Commune #commune
	- If we attack [[People and Orgs/Arkan the Cruel\|Arkan the Cruel]] with the purpose of taking tiamat's bloodwill Obitala come to his aid?
		- Pretty confident yes
	- Can Daemon deals be forced upon the signed without express informed consent? 
		- Confused and doubtful unclear
	- Does [[People and Orgs/People/Alsalasil\|Alsalasil]] know I have his lamp?
		- A reasuring yes
- Scrying on the windowsill of the prison Kyma's father
	- I am in a hall that has 4 doors leading off of it to the right. aT THE end of the hallway I can see the interior is gone. It falls off at the end of the hallway and i SEE INTO Avernus. I hear fire ans see smoke. On the left it turns to more interior. At the end of the hallway the ground is destroyed. 
- sCRYING TO Locate the building he is in
	- I see a wreaked flying fortress crahsed intot he ground of Avernus. It is half destroyed and opend up to the air. Weird slug looking creatures wander it's destryed bridge and a few ther mishapen creatures pitter around the area. In the distance I see the [[Places/Avernus/River Styx\|River Styx]], far in the distance. 

A totrle aproches us, he holds an intricate black staff and black armour. "Who dares stand in the pressence of Archon's tower" 

TAKE ELDRITCH SIGHT AS INVOCATION

*Dream*
I am in a forest. I see a shimmer of rainbow light in the distance and I follow it. I make a path, cutting way at leaves with a short sword. I feel like I'm slowly gaining on the light. I catch up to it and everything goes blinding white. I wake up in a forest, my body is compelled to move, to follow that same rainbow shimmer in the distance. I try and resist, only for a moment and start to feel a burning sensation in my eyes. The shimmering light pulls at me, like invisible chains hooked into my orbits. I move fast, streaming past the cleared and cut path, gaining on the shimmer. I catch up with it. Blinding white. I wake up in the woods. I already know what I need to to, I think I understand what's going on. I don't get up as much as I just start to move. Fast, not running, just willing motion, like flying without a body. I follow its rainbow light, catch up to it, over and over until I can see is the green of the forest, the rainbow shimmer, like an ethereal oil spill, and the blinding white. 

I wake up with glowing eyes. seeing magic.
