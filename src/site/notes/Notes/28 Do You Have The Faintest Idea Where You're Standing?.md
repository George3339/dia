-  [[People and Orgs/Deities and Beings of Power/Devil of Pain\|Paladin Danse]] is waiting with others in front of the tower
	- He came across a powerful magic item recently, it has and equally powerful curse. [[People and Orgs/People/Mahadi\|Mahadi]] was demanding a exobetant price to de curse it.
	- He wants to steal what he uses to de curse items
	- He found a belt of giant strength, when you put it on you loose all feeling below your neck 
- The tower rumbles a thunderous voice calls out from it "THE WIZARD HAS ARIVED" 
- Morty steps out. He looks intently into Kyma's eyes
	- "Your eyes! You've seen it too!! I need your blood and one of your toes before we even speak" 
## Morty
- We ask him what is going on with Kyma
	- "It's tough to say, but there is something brewing. I saw it in your eyes. The weave is a perfect entity and only the most calamitous events can so much as tweak it. What I saw in your eye, it's hard to explain, but perhaps it is the same magic. You've been crafting spells on this plane? So have I." **Kyma shows him the two vials of magical discharge and brings out the star**. "My goodness, quite interesting" **He goes to touch it and it recoils** "Have you seen the weave or not, that's what I was referring to when I saw your eyes"
	- "What are you looking for" "The sword of Zariel" "That's a big one, it's in the bleeding citadel" "We know that we need to know where the citadel is" "I'm afraid I don't know where it is but I can direct you to someone who does know. He's a wizard, except he is a mage of no renown I would think he doesn't have a name right now.  but if you were to visit him balance would be maintained in the universe.
		- Where would he be? "I'm afraid I can't tell you" Then how can you direct us to him? "He can be found near an obelisk on a hill. He has lost much of his power, likely withered, elderly, desperate, more likley to help you, but more importantly, there is an importnt imbalance occuring in the hells and there is very specifc series of events that need to occur for the world to not end. I sense great balance being restored. if you say I sent you I'm sure he would not hesitate to help you" 
	- He keeps grasping at Bras
