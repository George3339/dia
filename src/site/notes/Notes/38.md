*[[People and Orgs/PCs/Bras\|Bras]] called off a war party, [[People and Orgs/Mordenkainen\|Mordenkainen]] revealed himself to be a wizard who seems to have stolen [[People and Orgs/PCs/Kyma Crimsonfate\|Kyma]]'s father's equipment. We fought him till he teleported away, not before injuring Kyma significantly. We evaded a dragon's detection (for now) and have met with [[People and Orgs/Uldrach\|Uldrach]] an Empyrean. He gifted us his blood and tried to plane shift, when this failed he told us he needed to leave to fix this violation. We have just arrived at the [[Places/Avernus/Daemon Zapper\|Daemon Zapper]] and can see the dragon searching for us high in the sky.
