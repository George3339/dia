		- "Beautiful crimson. All I can say is that while the hue persists, you are following the path that is meant with it. Should the hue fade or shift, you mght be straying from your destiny. But while it persists and while it glows it means you are following the path. Only  few devils can tell you what it me. Be cautious of : There are many things of value in the hells, sometimes events align in the multiverse where the value of someone's action can trump the value of their soul."
