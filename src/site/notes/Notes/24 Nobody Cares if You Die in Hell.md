# Across the Styx
- The war machine is still there
	- There is a humanoid guy. He has green skin and it looks like tree roots as hair. He has some modded armour and a bunch of misc gear
	- "[[People and Orgs/People/The Smiler\|The Smiler]] has always got to stay on move."
	- He tells us there's rain coming and pisses
	- He's off to take down a war machine and then notes that another in the distance is [[People and Orgs/Deities and Beings of Power/Zariel\|Zariel]]'s war machine 
	- "Lots of wizards out now. Things are happening."
	- He sprouts black feathered wings and flies off
## Where to go
- Big glowy thing is the zapper. Where demons die
- Red forest might be where demons spawn
# On the Road Again
- We begin making our way to the zapper
### Lane Approaches Me
-  If [[People and Orgs/PCs/Kyma Crimsonfate\|Kyma]] talks to his father a contract will be completed and we will be marked for death 
	- He is only telling Me and [[People and Orgs/PCs/Bras\|Bras]]
- Looking around I notice far in the back distance a small war machine, probably a motorcycle 
## 3 War machines
They pull up on us, there is one that looks like ours but is gold plated
- At the head of this one there is an upside down deamon which is dripping blood into the enginge.
- The two other ones are piloted my mezoloths
- The pilot of the main one we recognize from the [[Places/Avernus/Wandering Emporium\|Wandering Emporium]] 
	- She has a bunch of undead running her car
- We fuck them up but the caster casts time stop
	- As she passes us "See you around"
## In the Ring
- I study the dark shard again
	- I don't get much more info than last time. I see a glimpse of green goo pit under me as I fly through the air
- While the others drive they see [[People and Orgs/People/Paladin Danse\|Paladin Danse]] pass by them on a war machine 
## Approaching the [[Places/Avernus/Daemon Zapper\|Daemon Zapper]]
- There is a unicorn encased in an orb which seems to power? the zapper
- A Dao comes out of the ground. She is [[People and Orgs/People/Ralzala\|Ralzala]]. As she emerges she casts tongues
	- She defends Mooncolour. She was tasked with defending it. It destroys fiends 
	- She is bound here due to a pact she made with [[People and Orgs/Deities and Beings of Power/Zariel\|Zariel]]
	- "Zariel is near Godhood"
	- She knows someone who could help us oppose Zariel
		- [[People and Orgs/Deities and Beings of Power/Bel\|Bel]] would do anything to overthrow Zariel
		- She wants us to help us free her from her pct with Zariel
		- As for the sword, I can only imagine that Bell would know where it is
	- How do we break your contract
		- There is a forest nearby, in there dwells a magic user know as [[People and Orgs/People/Red Ruth\|Red Ruth]] she can help me end my pact.
			- She is cunning and not to be trifled with
	- "I have not enslaved others before. I have little to show you but you may look into my thoughts" She pauses and then slams her hammer into thin air. "There are some who would look to discover knowledge by magical means, I can detect them"
