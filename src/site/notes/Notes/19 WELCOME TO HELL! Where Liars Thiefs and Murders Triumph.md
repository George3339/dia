#Dragon  
We show maggie the map
- We are left of the styx
- Somewhere in the bottom left quarter

# Out on the Open Road
- It has a racecar wheel, and buttons and switches. [[People and Orgs/People/Chukka\|Chukka]] and [[People and Orgs/People/Clonka\|Clonka]] give us an introduction
	- 1 Soul coin fuels it for 1 day. 
	- Don't trust anyone or anything
- A crack of lightning hits in the distance, we see the outline of a dragon in the distance

	- I take some scraps and a wheel
- [[People and Orgs/PCs/Donkus Ironbrew\|Donkus]] sprouts the goodberry shrub 
	- The shrub is frail and lacking in life and energy

## After a While
We arrive at the river styx. It's a flowing murky river. 
- We travel north and encounter a ramp going towards the styx
	- The car is really heavy, it would be very risky to jump it
- Chest clutched by a dead man
	- 500 GP 
	- 500 SP 
	- 3 Sapphires worth 300 GP
	- 3 diamonds worth 1000 GP
- Speak with dead to the guy with the chest
	- Are the contents of the chest safe?
		- My gold, they. It is untainted and safe
	- Who killed you?
		- This guy turned red and devils descended onto the city, I couldn't run, I could only protect what was rightfully mine.
	- How do we get over the [[Places/Avernus/River Styx\|River Styx]]
		- Swim
	- Who were you?
		- My name was Franklin Tedsworth. I was the pension manager for the upper class wihin Eltaurel
	- How did you get here from Eltaurel
		- The ground was coming apart. I jumped and aimed for the river.
- Donkus plants a bean and a pear tree grows
	- I eat one of the pears
		- I feel like my spine is clenching and twitching a third arm grows from my back. I have it for four days
- We see a glowing thing by the side of the water
	- It looks like a stone of pure arcane energy just lying there. I glows a white light with ripples of blue and yellow.
	- [[People and Orgs/PCs/Kyma Crimsonfate\|Kyma]] picks it up
		- His eyes glow for a while after picking it up
		- It pulses slightly in Kyma's hand
		- Kyma identifies it in the car
			- Consumed by crushing it
			- There is an element of personal expression. It reacts differently to different types of magic that the user channel 
- Lane wants to share something
	- It's a racist poem about dwarves
		- "It's NOt abOuT DWArves"
- Kyma crushes the stone 
	- His skin becomes a deeper darker blue #Kyma_Tranformation
