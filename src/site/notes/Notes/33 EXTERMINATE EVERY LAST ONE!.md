On the third floor we see [[People and Orgs/People/Sunspark\|Sunspark]], he looks like he has gained some devilish traits. He wears a bronze medalion with a gold trim which bears this insignia![Pasted image 20251007210024.png|300](/img/user/z%20Photos/Pasted%20image%2020251007210024.png)
- When asked about the medalion he responds that he got it from his clan
	- When pushed he admits that he found the medalion
		- 19 Insight: He's trying to withold some prietty bad details 
			- Who did you kill to get it?
				- Well it's not any concern anymore. Only soldiers can be reborn.
					- Who did you kill to get it? Indimidation 19
						- He was a nobody, just some dwarf that crawled down from [[Places/Eltaurel/Elturel\|Elturel]]. He was already gead, there was a swarm of imps about to kill him.

# We rest in the Chain Devil Tower

I call on the sending stone. The voice sounds like [[People and Orgs/People/Mistress Miranda\|Mistress Miranda]]. 
I cast atonement on Kyma
- I return Kyma to Lawfull Good
Talking about killing [[People and Orgs/People/Sunspark\|Sunspark]]
- When a devil dies in Hell their soul is retuned to the [[Places/Avernus/River Styx\|River Styx]]
	- If a higher power devil wished them rencarnated they can change the fate of that soul
- When I wake up I think "Today could be a big day. Today I could accomplish a lot"

## The Morning
- Reading the abyssal from Kyma's dream says "Soul, Vessel, Space"
- I use the crane to move the war machine over the Styx
- Scrying on [[People and Orgs/Mizora\|Mizora]]
	- I see her surounded by a caravan of war machines that have parked in agathering of shops. I see her  walk over to [[People and Orgs/People/Mistress Miranda\|Mistress Miranda]]. She goes "Any prospects old freind?" "Oh, you know it., the war is getting interesing isn't it?" "More than ever, I can't imagine. But I'm glad we're on the same side." "Aren't we all" (Both those last lines have a disengenous tone to them) Mizora looks over Miranda and then smiles at her nd then she tuns back around and notices the scrying. She looks at the senso and goes "Oh dear, can't I have a moment of peace?"
- Lulu tells us "Mahadi was giving me a really weird familliar feeling. It's the same feeling I get with the sword and other stuff. I just dont know how I remeber him or what he did."

# Wandering Emporium 
- We get off at the [[Places/Avernus/Wandering Emporium\|Wandering Emporium]]
- Mizora hands me a contract
	- "Here [[People and Orgs/PCs/Eamonn\|Eamonn]] I fixed the issues in the contract. i hope we can set this here. I don't want you to become a stranger"
	- The amended contract appears in my hands
-  I pray to Sunnis
	- I get a feeling. Any time throught my life that I've prayed and felt faith. There's no sign, no magic, but as I finish the payer it's like every time I've prayed before all this crazy shit. it's like I'm one of many to pray to Sunnis. 
- I sign the contract
	- The contract immediately erupts into flames
	- Mizora flies over to me "I'm so glad with your decison pet. I look forward to our productive relationship. And I hope "
	- Before she leaves "Will you be providing an alternative vesssel"
	- She hands me the Dao Lantern 
- Prayer to my father
	- Father, Lord of Chains, I have found and secured the lantern that was stolen from us. I have had to sacrifice much, including my connection to you, to retrieve it. I have gone to the hells for you, I have put my soul on the line for you. I have retrieved your lantern, I ask for your forgiveness, I beg for your mercy, and I praise you for your fairness.
