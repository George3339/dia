*A bulette charging [[People and Orgs/PCs/Donkus Ironbrew\|Donkus]] and [[People and Orgs/PCs/Eamonn\|Eamonn]] and the alarm spell sounding from the War Machine; our rest interrupted, we fight.*

# We Fight

## Bullette
- We incapacitate it and wail on it

## Car
- "So you're the brave one?" is heard as a glowing axe is thrown at [[People and Orgs/PCs/Bras\|Bras]]
- We see a devil looking teifling as she calls back her axe
- She kills Bras
-
