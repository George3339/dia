*A bulette charging [[People and Orgs/PCs/Donkus Ironbrew\|Donkus]] and [[People and Orgs/PCs/Eamonn\|Eamonn]] and the alarm spell sounding from the War Machine; our rest interrupted, we fight.*

# We Fight

## Bullette
- We incapacitate it and wail on it

## Car
- "So you're the brave one?" is heard as a glowing axe is thrown at [[People and Orgs/PCs/Bras\|Bras]]
- We see a devil looking teifling as she calls back her axe 
- She kills [[People and Orgs/PCs/Bras\|Bras]]
- She leaves on a bike
- [[People and Orgs/PCs/Kyma Crimsonfate\|Kyma]] revivifies Bras, a light dark aura surrounds him only visible to Kyma

- In the distance I see her motorcycle driving away and behind her was a humanoid creature with wings
# Resting
## Fixing the Car
- The demon zapper takes a minute to recharge 
- Kyma catnaps Donkus, Eamonn, and Bras
	- [[People and Orgs/PCs/Lane Wayne\|Lane]] convinces him to check his chest. He has the closed lid of an eye from his collarbone to his bellybutton. Protruding from him are four black tentacles. 
		- 25 Arcana. It can't be anything other than some kind of pact. 

## Donkus' Sex Dream
You wake up in your bed in your hometown. You walk out and walk through a faint memory in your village. You're compelled to walk through the woods. As you do, you hear a voice "Donkus, Donkus, come join me". Sitting in a bed of flowers and vines you see a beautiful silhouette of a woman lying sexily. She's wearing a leaf dress. "Join me Donkus" **"I would pounce"** He 'engages' She says "I love you Donkus". "It's me. Don't you have faith? What's wrong?" "Just tell me your name, you know mine" "I'm the woman of your dreams, I'm the mother of the forest, i'm her" "Are you the [[People and Orgs/Deities and Beings of Power/Chauntea\|Earth Mother]]?" "Yes child. Be loyal to me" "I already am" "That's all I wanted to hear." The last thing you remember fromt he dream is a prick on your neck as she sucks on your neck. 

## Lane Dreams
You have this pounding feeling, you almost expect to be approached but you just see the scale, the image of [[People and Orgs/Deities and Beings of Power/Kelemvor\|Kelemvor]]. It grows larger and larger as you hear "Balance" repeated over and over. The side of the scale you are on goes up and you feel a burning feeling in tour chest. You look over at the other arm of the scale and you see burning and hell. All you think about is how to restore balance. "What can I do to restore balance" He thinks about the [[Sword of Zariel\|Sword of Zariel]] slicing through the chains, the sword appears on the scale and it barely budges. He thinks of his hand extended with the sword of Zariel. 

He thinks of Bras. Bras appears on the scale, bras is now here in dreams. "What is this?" "This is the balance that needs to be restored" "Because I fucking died? What?" "This is a brainstorming session" The scale balances a bit

He thinks of [[People and Orgs/PCs/Kyma Crimsonfate\|Kyma]]'s dad. He floats toward the scale, he is pale and ghostly. "I won't be enough, I've lost"

"You are required for the solution" "How risky are we getting?" "This is a no risk zone" Lane cuts himself and the scale lowers a little, further cutting himself does nothing. "BALANCE IT BALANCE IT" sounds in Lane's head

Bras thinks of [[People and Orgs/Deities and Beings of Power/Bel\|Bel]], he falls onto the scale with them. "Give me that" and Lane lets the sword of Zariel fall into the inky black. The scale goes to even and then more than even, and then he wakes up. 

# I dream
I dream of a peaceful day with my family, it a place I do not recognize, but a place that is safe. The day passes as it does and I find myself going down to the cellar. The last thing I see as I wake up is a figure bound in chains. It could be Lane, it might not be

# Fortunes
#Tarot 
Bras reads Donkus and Kyma's fortune
- He pulls the depths for himself
Donkus
- Devil: Tentacles, a ship floats across the water
- Star: The stars guide the sails
- Herophant: The indulgences, a half cracked open crate holds rum and food and candies
All upright, the tentacles are usually addled on a substance, or addiction of a kind, wether a substance or emotion. Chasing after something or needing it
Star, faith hope, trying t see a better future. 
Indulgences, tradition, ethics, what you believe
You need to have faith in your morals, to not stray from the path addictions may be leading you from

Kyma
- Temperance: The lockup, scagled hair falls over lost eyes, 
- The tower: Reveresed. The mirage. THose who become too enthralled with the light might miss that the waves
- The World: A man in the crows nest points out to the horizon. Haven
The lockup, upright. Finding meaning, or perhaps the middle path instead of the extremes.
The mirage reveresed. Disaster avoided disaster dellayed, or perhaps with the world revesed, fear of suffering
The mirage reveresed, 
The three of these, perhaps fining meaning in the lack fo closure that you might end up getting. And your fear of that emotional turmoil. 

# We set out
#Dragon 
As we set out we see a huge white dragon fly over us. It stabilizes 105 feet above us "Allow me to introduce myself. I am [[Obatala\|Obatala]] and you have something of mine. I am unsure of where you carry it but i am certain it is within your possession. Should you wish to spare all your lives I will be requesting that you relinquish it to me in a calm and cooperating manner. Because I have no problem evicerating all of you where you sit."

"What stone"
"The dark touched one"
I stop the war machine and hand the stone to him
"More boring than I anticipated but thank you for your cooperation"
 DT
 Surface level
 "The worms are more frightened than I thought, this will be easy. We are one step closer my queen"
