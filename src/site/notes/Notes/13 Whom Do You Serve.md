# The Graveyard
- [[People and Orgs/People/Lulu\|Lulu]] speaks to us
	-  The sky here is darkness but there are occasional rays of light
		- As Lulu speaks "Guys, I just got a good feeling. I think you all can do this."
		- As she says this, light opens from the sky and we all level up 
## The Chapel
- Three skeleton minotaurs 
- Peek
	- The room has a large table, books. I see two insect like creatures standing guard
	- From across the room another curtain opens
		- Humanoid dark skinned person with dreads, he seems to notice me
- We defeat the minotaur and walk inside the room
	- "I can hear you"
	- The man inside has glowing eyes and looks to be enhanced with necrotic energy
		- ![Pasted image 20241129213104.png|300](/img/user/z%20Photos/Pasted%20image%2020241129213104.png)
		- I hadn't thought there was more to you all
			- It seems that one of you has already declared for our leader (looks at Bras)
		- "My name is- There's something coming. Demons" 
	- The two other creatures are Mezaloths
	- The name of the man is [[People and Orgs/People/Gideon Lightward\|Gideon Lightward]] 
		- The blood of the Demon we killed moves, I ask if it's alive, 
			- That's just daemon blood
				- Is it poisonous?
					- You would survive.
		- What are you
			- Blesses, unique, reborn. [[People and Orgs/Deities and Beings of Power/Zariel\|Zariel]]'s power flows through his veins. 
			- The duke is downstairs
	- I pick up one of the Minitour Gores 
## The Ossuary 
- I search the entrance room for any intact jars or vials Investigation 15
	- I find an old elixir of arcane cultivation 
		- Extra 2nd lvl spell slot until next long rest
- As I step out into the hallway I hear a voice that seems familiar. It sounds like the pain devil
	- "Who's there?"
- We catch up to [[People and Orgs/Deities and Beings of Power/Devil of Pain\|Devil of Pain]]. He tries to attack me but misses. He really want's out name 
	- One of his eyes looks kind of like the colour of my eldritch blast. The other is an orange colour
	- As I kill him I ask, what do you want from us? 
		- I thought it was obvious 
### Water room
- There is a fresco of the 
- A bunch of dead humans in the water
- [[People and Orgs/People/Ulder Ravenguard\|Ulder Ravenguard]] is there with three soldiers
- There is portal, 3 minotaur appear
	- Ricard, one of the Duke's soldiers, dies
- The portal
	- It is similar to the companion
- The bodies
	- Scroll of tongues 
	- Others
		- Scroll of mass healing word
		- Scroll of Remove curse
# High Hall Crypt
We bring the Duke to the room with the big table
- What do you know about what is affecting the duke?
	- Nothing
	- He is wearing the helm of [[People and Orgs/Deities and Beings of Power/Torm\|Torm]]
		- It is supposed to posses the user with Torm so they become his weapon
- Kyma identifies a soul coin
	- Equals 100 gp of any spell component 
- The druid proposes a ritual of returning 
	- Needs an altar, a symbol of Torm, and an incantation
- As the short rest ends Kyma gets a sending from his father
	- Limit, sending uses. They're listening. Demon deals work differently. Stay away from me at all costs. No matter what.
		- I'll weigh my options to see how heavy the cost. Please try to stay safe. I will too. 
- As we return to the crypt an imp fles throuh the window with a message
	- "Is there a [[People and Orgs/PCs/Lane Wayne\|Lane Wayne]] here? I have a message from the God of Murder. He needs to inform you that he hopes you will reconsider and he's willing to compromise. All you have to do is renounce your current deity and call out to the heavens."
		- I kill him
			- Speak with dead
				- Who is Lane Wane currently worshiping?
					- I don't know. That's what Bhall told me
				- What's the new offer?
					- I don't know what the offer is. It's for Bhall for Lane to become Bhaal's chosen. Something about a limit
						- 17 Religion: There is Bhaal's chose, Bhaal's spawn. It's partly what he's talking about, but this seems like something new. The part about a 'limit' makes no sense. If a god wants something they can usually do it. For a god to be described s having a limit is odd.
				- What is Bhaal interested in Lane for?
					- The sky shoots with lightning. "He said lane is an apostle and he wants him. But he was taken when Lane rejected Bhaal."
				- Where in the Avernus did you come from?
					- I came from the sky. The only place Bhall can shout into this plane now, for some reason.
				- What is the state of the blood war?
					- Lots of contenders but Zariel is winning.
	- I ask Lane, When did Bhaal first call to you
