# The chapel 
- There's a hole in the ground with a purple mist around it. [[People and Orgs/PCs/Eamonn\|Eamonn]] drops a rock down and it hits a bottom

- Casting Kept Memories on [[People and Orgs/People/Lulu\|Lulu]]
	- We see Lulu flying next to two kenku, next to them is a large heavily armoured infernal vehicle. The ground is sand and behind the machine is a large wall of metal and scraps. Around there are goblin like creatures on the ground. It seems like a fort, there are more vehicles in the distance. Lulu flies up a bit and we see the fort. We see a heavily robed humanoid slowly walking past the kenku. It has horns and some spikes from their shoulders, we see two red eyes over a blurry face. There's a tall fleshy lumbering creature, as it walks by we hear "get back to work" and the kenku go back to the infernal war machine and start working on it, then a bell rings. 

# Awaking in Hell... Again

	- We carry him down
- Underneath us a battle rages
