## [[People and Orgs/People/Silveira Savicast\|Silveira Savicast]]'s Office
 - Tells us that people are looking for [[People and Orgs/PCs/Bras\|Bras]]. 
	 - There was a council meeting about it, everyone wants to get him
	 - He is allegedly involved with some criminals that have a history with candlekeep
	 - He is also banned from Candlekeep
	 - [[People and Orgs/People/Avir\|Avir]] is looking for him
- We meet Avir and he magically marks Bras 
	- Avir casts detect thoughts on Kyma
- She hands us a map of [[Places/Avernus\|Avernus]]
- [[People and Orgs/People/Traxagor\|Traxagor]] is hosting someone names [[People and Orgs/People/Lulu\|Lulu]] who has a history of fighting devils
# The Flight of the Griffons
- There are a fleet of griffons waiting to transport us to Traxigor
- I am hesitant about flying, but we each get one for ourselves (though Bras and [[People and Orgs/PCs/Donkus Ironbrew\|Donkus]] are flying together)
- Why did Bras steal
{ #f07add}

	- It was related to his field of study at the time
	- He had interest in Water genasi and cults relating to the sea
	- He did so with a companion, she said that she would help with his research, but they got caught because she drew attention. 
- We fly north along the [[Places/Sword Coast\|Sword Coast]], and land on a floating wizard tower
## In the Tower of Traxigor
- We head down
- An otter ([[People and Orgs/People/Traxigor\|Traxigor]] in this form) invites us in
- Lulu is a flying elephant 
- Kyma's father was teleported out of here
	- He mentioned his regrets about [[People and Orgs/PCs/Kyma Crimsonfate\|Kyma]] needing to go to [[Places/Avernus\|Avernus]]
	- He also mentioned that he knows that Kyma needs to go to Avurnus
	- Kyma is given a pair of gloves from her father
- Lulu 
	- She was with [[People and Orgs/Deities and Beings of Power/Zariel\|Zariel]] when she assembled her army of hellriders and was still an angel
		- They were about to win
			- Before she was captured she was told to hide Zariel's sword but she can't remember where
				- It's still hidden in Avernus
			- She can't remember how she lost her memory
		- She remembers some of the hellriders betrayed them as they almost won
- Traxigor gave us a bunch of magic items and scrolls
- Kyma proposes a spell he crafted as a way to get Lulu's memories back
	- In response Traxigor tells her she is going to Avernus with us. He believes this is the best way to get her memory back. 
- If we find his brother [[People and Orgs/People/Kraxigor\|Kraxigor]] "stop with the cosplays and maybe come home for a bit"
- Based on my last scrying it's a rough estimate but
	- He hands us a feather falling scroll
	- Be careful of devils
	- You'll probably want to go to the big building, the high hall, if Ravenguard is still there find him
	- He casts Plane Shift 
### A Shift and A Jump
We immediately feel the heat of the air in [[Places/Avernus\|Avernus]] as we appear 100 feet above [[Places/Eltaurel/Elturel\|Elturel]]. [[People and Orgs/PCs/Kyma Crimsonfate\|Kyma]] casts feather fall and slows our fall and we float down to the streets of Eltaurel.
- We look around and see swarms of imps flying around massive flying war machines. The city below us has 8 massive pitons jammed into each end of the city that is bound by chains bound to the surface of Avernus. The city is split in two. A mote of lava encircles the east side of the city.
- A sphere of darkness shoots the city, perched atop a bluff a ruined fortress stands. 
- We land in the streets and see group of citizens, a mother and 2 boys come out of a half collapsed house. They are starving and looking for food. 3 Bearded devils start to approach them
	- Bras's tentacle summon is now a proper black tentacle 
- The family's mother's name is [[People and Orgs/People/Harkna\|Harkna]]. They need to get to [[Places/Eltaurel/High Hall\|High Hall]], I offer to bring them there. 
- We hear a man caught under a burning building and go in to try and save him
	- After we save him we are assaulted by 2 Bulazau. 
	- One of the Bulazau kills one of the sons of the family we saved
	- We save the man, a Duregar named [[People and Orgs/People/Malistair\|Malistair]]
