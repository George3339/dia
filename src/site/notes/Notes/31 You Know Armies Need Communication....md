*With [[Karlach\|Karlach]]'s brother dead we continue on our quest.*

---

# A Dead Adversary and an Ambush
- Two winged devils attack us
- One of them has
	- 1 soul coin
- [[Karlach\|Karlach]]'s brother's ashes seem to form a lemure
	- I take his head to cast speak with dead
# On the Road
We ride uninterrupted for an hour.
- it feels like we haven't seen much in a while, crossing quite open areas, makes us feel exposed. 
- We notice a blurry figure flying low alongside us, speeding to cross us.
	- The creature has wings and what looks to be green armor
	- We see [[People and Orgs/People/The Smiler\|The Smiler]] fly across and hit the side of the war machine.
	- Detect Thoughts
		- Surface: Nothing to see, nothing over there, must of lost her, keep moving keep moving good.
		- Deeper: ![Pasted image 20250912213412.png](/img/user/Pasted%20image%2020250912213412.png)
		- We see a static figure in the sky, it is [[People and Orgs/Deities and Beings of Power/Zariel\|Zariel]]
	- Explain yourself 
		- You owe me an explanation. I've done more for the city than you all have, I'm out here saving the innocent
		- Big new, the blood war is ramping up. Exited to see what happens next.
		- Where are you going? Wherever the war takes me
		- Detect Magic: He has a shortsword with some magic on it, and a few little things in his pouch
		- Why was [[People and Orgs/Deities and Beings of Power/Zariel\|Zariel]] after you? I suppose I upset her a little bit. There was a powerful demon that went down, I just managed to stash it before I got away.
		- The devil was Orcus
		- It's in a giant pit of green slime. He seems to be fairly truthful
## Mizora pops in for a visit
- "[[People and Orgs/PCs/Eamonn\|Eamonn]] darling, I couldn't help but notice that you "
- I let her know my issues with the contract
	- She looks disappointed "I was hoping you'd be more sensible, but I suppose I can wait, the question though is can you?"

## The arches
- As we arive at our location [[People and Orgs/Deities and Beings of Power/Garguth\|Garguth]] speaks us "We made a wrong turn, consider this my appology"
	- We arrive at two oranate black arches. Every inch of stonework detailed with devils fighting demons
	- Where are we "Wrong place, just turn around."
- We hear a humming coming from the arches
	- The humming gets louder as you get closer
- Powerful conjuration magic comes from each portal
- It looks like there is a lot more going in than coming out of the portals. i even notice some war machine tracks. 

# The Obelisk
A 30ft tall obelisk rises front he crest of the hill. A tall man in rags gesticulating wildly nd swearing at the wind.
- You can free me, finally, salvation. I was trapped here long ago, the mosnter that put me here destroyed my mind. I can no longer recall my name and where I came from. But I have retained odd peices of lore that might be of use to you. If you each touch one of the standing stones. 
- Each of the standing stones emits a different type of magic
	- The central one is abjuration
- Do you know about the blood war, about Zariel? "I know it is happening, I know of Zariel"
- Detect Magic: I notice illusion magic emanating from him
- Detect Thoughts: It should work, it should work, just get them to touch the stones. If it dosn't work then I'll know for sure
- "I know someone who can lead you to the [[Sword of Zariel\|Sword of Zariel]]"
- Probe: He is desperate, he believes that it would work to free him. Mephistopheles be damned if I don't find a way out myself. Olanthius would know where the citadel is.
- Show us your real self. 
	- "Let me ask you something, do you oppose Zariel"
		- A large demon with orange fur and big tusks. "I am Ubelax the demon, and we are not enemies" 
		- They cary faint magic, it should be harmless, just touching them should be harmless. 
	- I put my hand on the divination standing stone
		- I gain the benefit of a true seeing spell for the next hour
			- I see an aura around Bras
			- I see a faint green aura from Donnkus' hand
				- I see whisps that are closest to kyma's eyes n colour
			- Whisps of black and white around Lane's head
			- I see a purple/blue aura around Kyma
			- I can see a green/turquise steam coming from Lane's palm
	- As Kyma touches the Evocation stone 5 magic missiles shoot out from it
	- As Donkus touches the Enchantment stone, it's as if a spell tries to infiltrate his mind
	- As Bras touches the Necrotic stone he takes 30 damage as it sucks the life out of him
	- As Lane tocuhes the Illusion stone magic pulses from the stone as a swarm of ravens swarms around his head
	- Lulu touches the Abjuration stone and her AC goes up
- We touch all the stones and he is still restrained. It would seem my fate stays in the hand of a sigular devil. You must go to the mirror of mefistar and contact Mephistopheles. 
- Lulu knows who Olantheus is
	- He was one of the [[People and Orgs/Orgs/Hellriders\|Hellriders]] with [[People and Orgs/Deities and Beings of Power/Zariel\|Zariel]] before she fell
As we leave the sending stone begins to ring
- It sounds like a woman "Red ruth? Who am I speaking to" "Who is this?" "I asked you first." *The voice reminds you of a voice you encountered around the time you went to the wandering emporium* "Is this somone from the wandering emporium?" "So Red Ruth is dead I presume?" "Well Yeah." "Can you put Donkus on?" As Donkus says hello it hangs up. 
- After another hour of travel we arrive at a watchtower next to the styx.
