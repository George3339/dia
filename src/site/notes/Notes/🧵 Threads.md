## The Contract and the Companion

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">





A celestial Planar ally dormant inside [[Places/Eltaurel/Elturel\|Elturel]]

From the contract between Overseer [[People and Orgs/People/Creig\|Creig]] and [[People and Orgs/Deities and Beings of Power/Zariel\|Zariel]] "I hearby submit to Zariel, all lands falling under the shine of the companion. This deal will last 50 years.

The companion is Zariel's hold on the city. Her fiendish friend, her key.

- What if we killed the companion?

A way to potentially bind the city to the deal. All the souls of [[Places/Eltaurel/Elturel\|Elturel]] are bound to [[People and Orgs/Deities and Beings of Power/Zariel\|Zariel]].

### Sword of Zariel 
<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



Before [[People and Orgs/People/Lulu\|Lulu]] was captured she was told to hide [[People and Orgs/Deities and Beings of Power/Zariel\|Zariel]]'s sword but she can't remember where.
The Grand Duke mentions the sword in his recounting of the visions he saw when wearing the [[Magic Items not owned/Helm of Torm\|helm of Torm]]. 
	"I was having like a dream. There were people fighting for my consciousness. I saw things. There was a woman in armour, angelic, with a long **sword**. Next to her there was some sort of flying elephant. There was also a big demon, threatening to kill and devour the woman. Something that looked like Lulu made a trumpet sound and the demon was flung away. And **then a large palace erupted around a sword of some kind**, and the scab, flesh began to engulfed the palace and the elephant flew off. The Demon was engulfed with the palace, and then. There were two bird people in weird armour, black birds. Strange machines, some sort of big metal tool."
[[People and Orgs/People/Ulder Ravenguard\|Ulder Ravenguard]]: the sword of [[People and Orgs/Deities and Beings of Power/Zariel\|Zariel]] is crucial, if you find it it could change the fate of the city. You may also need to find the contract made with Zariel.

## Dragons and The Cult of Tiamat

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



A cult worshipping the evil dragon goddess [[People and Orgs/Deities and Beings of Power/Tiamat\|Tiamat]]. We encountered them outside the bathhouse in [[Places/Baldur's Gate/Baldur's Gate\|Baldur's Gate]]'s Upper City.

</div></div>

**Other Notes**
- We have seen a dragon on our way to [[Places/Candlekeep\|Candlekeep]] as well as in [[Places/Avernus/Avernus\|Avernus]]. The dragon on out way to Candlekeep was a white dragon with a broken metal shackle around it's neck. 
- We have been told that there are some dragons in the skull like thing on the top left of our map by [[People and Orgs/People/Paladin Danse\|Paladin Danse]].
- [[People and Orgs/Uldrach\|Uldrach]]

## The Lamp and Guts

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



Man in [[Places/Eltaurel/Elturel\|Elturel]] who was sold the genie lamp.  He has short spiky black hair, and a large sword and had one eye closed he is human. He is now wanted all throughout [[Places/Avernus/Avernus\|Avernus]] by order of Zariel. 

Acording to [[People and Orgs/People/Cronk Srublife\|Cronk Srublife]] he wanted the lamp for magical puposes

## Pain

When he first showed up he was small, as he died over and over he has progressively gotten stronger. He seems to show an ability to adapt to our commonly used spells/attacks. He shows a general ability to adapt in general. 
**Pain Encounters**
1. In front of [[Places/Eltaurel/Torm's Bridge\|Torm's Bridge]], he climbed out of a sewer grate and [[People and Orgs/PCs/Kyma Crimsonfate\|Kyma]] burnt him with acid 
2. Outside of [[Places/Eltaurel/High Hall\|High Hall]], he turned his hands to knives and [[People and Orgs/PCs/Eamonn\|People and Orgs/PCs/Eamonn]] killed him with an eldritch blast
3. Inside the ossuary of [[Places/Eltaurel/High Hall\|High Hall]]'s Chapel. One of his eyes looks to be the colour of my eldrich blast, the other is orange. 
4. He ambushes us on our way down the chains from [[Places/Eltaurel/Elturel\|Elturel]]. When he sees me wearing the same amulet he is he says "What? You!? I will not accept that!!!". He gets pushed off the chain but grows wings to fly. I steal his crimson amulet of his corpse before later selling it to [[People and Orgs/People/Mad Maggie\|Mad Maggie]]. 
5. He ambushes us as we are resting at Mad Maggie's, holding a knife to Lulu's throat. Here is where he first binds one of us ([[People and Orgs/PCs/Eamonn\|People and Orgs/PCs/Eamonn]]) to his forced contract after collecting all of our names.  To enact the contract he seems to need to clap his hands together.
He wants and not has all of our names. He seems to be able to use them to force us into a contract which binds us to him, making the one bound be inflicted with any wound inflicted onto Pain
