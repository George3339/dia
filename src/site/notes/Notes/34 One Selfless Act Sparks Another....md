# Wandering emporium
The crowd is denser than ususal, there seems to be a lot of riders coming in. Next to the Salamanders that reads "War machine tune ups! Priority for racers"

Mahadi tells us that the race is today and the prise is
	A big black sphere, inside of it is a dark heavily annotated, it is the book of vile darkness. 

## Sell To Mahadi
A bag of devouring
2 Vials of Holy Water

As I turn to leave I see [[People and Orgs/Bitterbreath\|Bitterbreath]] stnding over me.

## Miranda

"if you're worried about people coming after you for killing Red Ruth, I'd say it's been a while, I'm sure the storm has passed." I notice something in what she said. I seemed like soemthing she said was inconsistent with what she was previously saying.
She reaches for something behind her table and fidget with it as we call her on the stone

## Danse
"I've sort of come to the realization that everyone here may as of now be the only hope for the city. And so the stakes for our current quest are more real than ever. Given that It might be worth getting to know eachother. There was something else but. I'll start, I was there when [[Places/Eltaurel/Elturel\|Elturel]] fell. i tracked down a cult into a basement and the ground began to shake. Fire and light shne through the cracks in the earth. I lost many friends that day, but made one ones! But before I get to my business tell me about yourselves."
- Kyma: I learnt recently that my father was captured in [[Places/Avernus/Avernus\|Avernus]]
"I need your help. I have a powerful item that I need de cursed. i'm not certain how it works, but there is definitely some sort of tool he's using, but he's never able to de curse them within sight of any other creature. Should the heist of finding out and taking advantage of it is not possible I will ask to borrow soul coins. "

### In My Ring
After talk to my dad, returning the lamp and telling him I understand him a bit. I hear nothing, but i feel a breath come from the tip of the lamp. A large relaxing breath. I feel a little poke on my chest. 

## The Hunchback
- "Hello-Hi, I couldn't help but notice the beutifull beast you rode in on. Were you thinking about going in the race. Do you need a grease monkey. For one soul coin a day I can keep your war machine fixed up. "
- Kyma: Why are yo in hr hells
	- "Are sent as devine beings from the god of war machines. I was cursed and forced to never me a rider"
- I hire him for a day and follow him to the war machine.


- As [[People and Orgs/Deities and Beings of Power/Devil of Pain\|Paladin Danse]] walks back to his bike in the parking lot I notice his eyes widen, his teeth part, [[People and Orgs/Deities and Beings of Power/Devil of Pain\|Pain]] appears with a ring of of wishes with one wish, the same one from "i WISH..." and turns and leaves on his bike
