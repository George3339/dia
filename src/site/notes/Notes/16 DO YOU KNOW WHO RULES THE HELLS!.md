# A Fight on the Chains
## Before we leave
- [[People and Orgs/People/Feria\|Feria]]: This book I have, it's the tome of the creed resolute. It lists every person bound by the creed, bound to [[People and Orgs/Deities and Beings of Power/Zariel\|Zariel]].
	- [[People and Orgs/People/Ulder Ravenguard\|Ulder Ravenguard]]: the sword of [[People and Orgs/Deities and Beings of Power/Zariel\|Zariel]] is crucial, if you find it it could change the fate of the city. You may also need to find the contract made with Zariel. 
	- They give us a potion of healing and a ring of jumping


# On the Chains
- When the [[People and Orgs/Deities and Beings of Power/Devil of Pain\|devil of pain]] sees me wearing the same red amulet I am wearing he says: "What? You!? I will not accept that!!!"
- [[Kyma\|Kyma]] pushes the devil of pain off the chains but he then grows wings 
- "What do you mean me?"
	- He smiles, "It just means I want to kill you first Eamonn" As he says this, it's as if hell goes silent with a gasp. The fighting below us stops for a moment and Pain looks down. We all see an angelic figure descend into the battlefield.
		- The angelic creature is annihilating demons on the battlefield. 
			- Pain looks at us and says "Time to go"
			- I take the red amulet off his corpse as he dies and falls, it feels wrong, like it's not mine
				- I also have a thought enter my mind, *This could be bad*
					- It seems like some kind of organism (kyma knowledge)
# The Base of the Chain
- Near the base of the chain there is a battle between demons and devils
	- There's a larger creature, devil, commanding devils
		- [[People and Orgs/People/Lulu\|Lulu]]: That looks like [[People and Orgs/Deities and Beings of Power/Lucile\|Lucile]], one of Zariel's war-chiefs
- As we walk we see [[People and Orgs/PCs/Kyma Crimsonfate\|Kyma]]'s father in the sky on a flying carpet
{ #43e008}

- As we continue to walk we see a man in the distance walking to a flying fortress
- We fight some demons on our way
	- They hold a burlap sack, inside it is a dwarf
	- His name is [[People and Orgs/People/Sunspark\|Sunspark]] of the woodburn clan
	- What are you doing in the hells, 
		- "I'm looking someone"
	- Did you come when the city fell
		- "I came around the same time"
	- I collect a bottle of demon Ichor
	- Sunspark seems quite secretive
		- He seems to be a vampire
		-
