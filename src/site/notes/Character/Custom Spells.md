## Earth Fists
*Cantrip transmutation*

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Target:** A willing creature you touch  
**Components:** V S M (A clump of rough stone and clay)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute  
**Classes:** Druid, Cleric, Paladin, Warlock

You impart elemental energy into yours or a willing creature's hands. As you do so the target's hands are encrusted in magical stone. The target retains the dexterity of normal hands and can use their stone encrusted hands as they would normal hands. For the duration of the spell the target may make a melee spell attack against one creature within 5 feet with their fists, this attack deals 1d8 bludgeoning damage. The target can use the caster's spellcasting ability instead of Strength for the attack roll of the target's melee spell attack.  

Additionally, for the duration of the spell the target has advantage on checks made to initiate and maintain a grapple. 

Total immersion in water or exposure to heavy rainfall turns the hands to thick mud, making it impossible for the target to cast any spells with a somatic component, grasp or hold objects, or punch and smash with the fists, although they suffer no other ill effects.  

The spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

This sacrificed HP is coalesced into a pearl of energy that can be consumed by any creature as a bonus action to gain temporary HP equivalent to the amount sacrificed.

You suffuse a portion of your own life force into a gemstone. 
Upon casting the spell, the caster can choose to sacrifice a number of max HP equal to the full value of any number of their hit dice. This sacrificed HP is crystalized into a gemstone that can be crushed by any creature as a bonus action to recover the full value of the hit die sacrificed plus the spellcasting ability modifier of the caster.  Once the caster completes a long rest or if the gemstone is not crushed in 24 hours, the gemstone vanishes and the caster regains the sacrificed max HP.

On a failed save the creature takes 6d4 slashing damage or half as much on a successful save.

## Quicksand
*3rd-Level Conjuration*
**Casting Time:** 1 Action 
**Range:** 150 feet
**Components:** V, S, M (A handful of sand)
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You conjure a pit of quicksand at a point in range. The pit takes the form of a 20 foot radius circle of sinking and moving sand centred on a point in range . The area of the pit is considered difficult terrain. Any creature who starts their turn within the pit or enters its area must make a Strength Saving throw. On a failed save the creature is restrained and begins the sink into the quicksand. On a successful saving throw the creature breaks from the hold of the sand and is no longer restrained.

Every failed saving throw increases the DC of any subsequent saving throws caused by this spell by 1. When a creature fails a combined total of 3 saving throws it has sunk into the sand completely and begins to take damage as the sand squeezes the life out of them. At the begining of the turn that the creature fails the 3rd saving throw and every subsequent turn until it succeeds or the spell ends, the creature takes 6d8 bludgeoning damage and is blinded as well as restrained and does not have access to air to breathe.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the radius of the circle increases by 10 feet for each level above 3rd.

## Armour of Earth
*4th-Level Abjuration*
**Casting Time:** 1 Action 
**Range:** Self
**Components:** V, S, M (a plate of metamorphic rock)
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

With this spell, the caster creates a suit of armour around themselves composed of earth and stone. The armour of earth grants the caster an AC of 18, equal to plate armour. This armour is surprisingly light, weighing only 20 lbs., although its lack of flexibility reduces the wearer’s Dexterity score by 2 points and reduces their speed by 10 feet. All movement in the armour of earth is accompanied by a soft, gritty, grinding sound and it constantly sheds a small amount of dirt and sand which makes all stealth checks by the caster fail while the spell is active. However, every successful melee strike against the caster releases a spray of this same grit back at an attacker. Any creature within 5 ft of the caster who hits them with a melee attack must make a Constitution saving throw against the caster’s spell save DC. Failure indicates the grit has gotten into the attacker’s eyes and the creature is blinded until the end of it’s next turn. 

The caster can end this spell at any time using their reaction, and upon its end, either in this manner or when the spell expires, the armour of earth bursts into a brief cloud of sand and dirt in a 5-foot radius sphere around the caster; all those caught in the area other than the caster must make a Constitution saving throw versus the caster’s spell save DC to avoid being blinded until the end of their next turn. Creatures that do not rely on eyes for sight are immune to the blinding effect of this spell.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the caster gains +1 to concentration checks to maintain the spell per level above 4th.

## Wall of Crystals

*5th-level evocation*

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 120 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of powder made by crushing a clear gemstone)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

A wall of sharp shimmering crystal erupts from the ground. The wall is 6 inches thick and is composed of six 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with at least one other panel. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-20-foot panels that are only 3 inches thick.

If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.

The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can’t occupy the same space as a creature or object. The wall doesn’t need to be vertical or resting on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.

The wall is an object made of sharp but brittle crystal that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 13 and 10 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the DM’s discretion.

On one side of the wall, selected by you when you cast this spell, the ground erupts into small knifelike crystal shards. The area 15 feet from this side of the wall is considered difficult terrain. Each creature that ends its turn within 15 feet of that side of the wall must make a dexterity saving throw, on a failed save the creature takes 8d4,  or half as much damage on a successful save. A creature makes the same saving throw when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. The other side of the wall deals no damage. 

The crystals shatter and turn to worthless dust when the spell ends.

# Magic Items
## Tome of the Growing Wound
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)

Upon attuning to this tome, an open wound appears at on your body at a point of your choice. While attuned to this tome you may once per turn add 1d6 necrotic damage to any damage roll you make. 

**Curse of the Growing Wound:** Due to the corrupting nature of the tome your body reacts negatively to healing, anytime you heal hit points outside of taking a short or long rest take 1d6 necrotic damage. Additionally, the tome reacts negatively to any attempts to close the wound it is bound to. Whenever you recover your hit points to full take 1d6 necrotic damage (this damage stacks with the tomes reaction to non-rest healing).

## 'Lightly Used' Boots of Misty Step
Armour, very rare

The boots are made of an iron frame adorned with thick jet black leather. Each one has two wings of silver feathers, crudely stitched together. There are some dents in the metal, a few rips in the leather, and one of the wings is missing half its feathers.

While wearing the boots you can cast misty step at will without expending a spell slot. 

**Shoddy Craftsmanship:** Each time you use the boots to cast misty step roll a d12. On a 1 the boots malfunction, the spell is still cast but when you arrive at your chosen destination the boots arrive slightly misplaced, breaking your ankles. You immediately fall prone and take 2d12 force damage as your bones shatter.
