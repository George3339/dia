## Earth Fists
*Cantrip transmutation*

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Target:** A willing creature you touch  
**Components:** V S M (A clump of rough stone and clay)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute  
**Classes:** Druid, Cleric, Paladin, Warlock

You impart elemental energy into yours or a willing creature's hands. As you do so the target's hands are encrusted in magical stone. The target retains the dexterity of normal hands and can use their stone encrusted hands as they would normal hands. For the duration of the spell the target may make a melee spell attack against one creature within 5 feet with their fists, this attack deals 1d8 bludgeoning damage. The target can use the caster's spellcasting ability instead of Strength for the attack roll of the target's melee spell attack.  

Additionally, for the duration of the spell the target has advantage on checks made to initiate and maintain a grapple. 

Total immersion in water or exposure to heavy rainfall turns the hands to thick mud, making it impossible for the target to cast any spells with a somatic component, grasp or hold objects, or punch and smash with the fists, although they suffer no other ill effects.  

The spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

Upon casting the spell, the caster can choose to sacrifice a number of max HP equal to the full value of one of their hit die. This sacrificed HP is coalesced into a pearl of energy that can be consumed by any creature as a bonus action to gain temporary HP equivalent to the amount sacrificed. Once the caster completes a long rest or if the pearl is not consumed in 24 hours, the pearl vanishes and the caster regains the sacrificed max HP.

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You cut your palms and clasp transferring a portion of your endurance and regeneration to an ally.
You touch a creature, upon casting the spell, the caster can transfer any number of their unused hit dice to the target creature. The creature can then use those hit dice as if they were their own with the caveat that the dice size remains that of the caster. The caster looses access to the sacrificed hit dice. Once the caster completes a long rest or if the sacrificed hit dice are not used within 24 hours, the hit dice are removed from the target creature and any unused hit dice are lost.

**Casting Time:** 1 Action (ritual)
**Range:** Touch
**Components:** V, S, M (A gem worth 25 gold pieces which is consumed)
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You suffuse a portion of your own life force into a gemstone. 
Upon casting the spell, the caster can choose to sacrifice a number of max HP equal to the full value of any number of their hit dice. This sacrificed HP is crystalized into a gemstone that can be crushed by any creature as a bonus action to recover the full value of the hit die sacrificed plus the spellcasting ability modifier of the caster.  Once the caster completes a long rest or if the gemstone is not crushed in 24 hours, the gemstone vanishes and the caster regains the sacrificed max HP.

## Shardstorm 
*3rd-Level Conjuration*
**Casting Time:** 1 Action 
**Range:** 150 feet
**Components:** V, S, M (A pinch of powdered gems)
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute 

You conjure a dust storm of composed of millions of tiny crystalline shards. A 20-foot-radius 30 foot tall cylinder of swirling shining dust appears, centred on a point within range and lasting for the duration. The inside of the storm is heavily obscured. When a creature starts their turn in the storm they must make a dexterity saving throw. On a failed save the creature takes 6d4 slashing damage or half as much on a successful save. 

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the dealt increases by 2d4.

## Quicksand
*3rd-Level Conjuration*
**Casting Time:** 1 Action 
**Range:** 150 feet
**Components:** V, S, M (A handful of sand)
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You conjure a pit of quicksand at a point in range. The pit takes the form of a 20 foot radius circle centred on a point in range of sinking and moving sand. The area of the pit is considered difficult terrain. Any creature who starts their turn within the pit or enters it’s area must make a Strength Saving throw. On a failed save the creature is grappled and begins the sink into the quicksand. On a successful saving throw the creature breaks from the hold of the sand and is no longer grappled.

Every failed saving throw increases the DC of any subsequent saving throws caused by this spell by 1. When a creature fails a combined total of 3 saving throws it has sunk into the sand completely and begins to take damage as the sand squeezes the life out of them. On the turn that the creature fails the 3rd saving throw and every subsequent one until it succeeds or the spell ends the creature takes 6d8 bludgeoning damage.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the radius of the circle increases by 10 feet for each level above 3rd.

## Armour of Earth
*4th-Level Abjuration*
**Casting Time:** 1 Action 
**Range:** Self
**Components:** V, S, M (a plate of metamorphic rock)
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

With this spell, the caster creates a suit of armour around themselves composed of earth and stone. The armour of earth grants the caster an AC of 18, equal to plate armour. This armour is surprisingly light, weighing only 20 lbs., although its lack of flexibility reduces the wearer’s Dexterity score by 2 points and reduces their speed by 10 feet. All movement in the armour of earth is accompanied by a soft, gritty, grinding sound and it constantly sheds a small amount of dirt and sand which makes all stealth checks by the caster fail while the spell is active. However, every successful melee strike against the caster releases a spray of this same grit back at an attacker. Any creature within 5 ft of the caster who hits them with a melee attack must make a Constitution saving throw against the caster’s spell save DC. Failure indicates the grit has gotten into the attacker’s eyes and the creature is blinded until the end of it’s next turn. 

The caster can end this spell at any time using their reaction, and upon its end, either in this manner or when the spell expires, the armour of earth bursts into a brief cloud of sand and dirt in a 5-foot radius sphere around the caster; all those caught in the area other than the caster must make a Constitution saving throw versus the caster’s spell save DC to avoid being blinded until the end of their next turn. Creatures that do not rely on eyes for sight are immune to the blinding effect of this spell.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the caster gains advantage on concentration checks to maintain the spell.

# Magic Items
## Tome of the Growing Wound
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)

Upon attuning to this tome, an open wound appears at on your body at a point of your choice. While attuned to this tome you may once per turn add 1d6 necrotic damage to any damage roll you make. 

**Curse of the Growing Wound:** Due to the corrupting nature of the tome your body reacts negatively to healing, anytime you heal hit points outside of taking a short or long rest take 1d6 necrotic damage. Additionally, the tome reacts negatively to any attempts to close the wound it is bound to. Whenever you recover your hit points to full take 1d6 necrotic damage (this damage stacks with the tomes reaction to non-rest healing).

## 'Lightly Used' Boots of Misty Step
Armour, very rare

The boots are made of an iron frame adorned with thick jet black leather. Each one has two wings of silver feathers, crudely stitched together. There are some dents in the metal, a few rips in the leather, and one of the wings is missing half its feathers.

While wearing the boots you can cast misty step at will without expending a spell slot. 

**Shoddy Craftsmanship:** Each time you use the boots to cast misty step roll a d12. On a 1 the boots malfunction, the spell is still cast but when you arrive at your chosen destination the boots arrive slightly misplaced, breaking your ankles. You immediately fall prone and take 2d12 force damage as your bones shatter.
