## Eldritch Blast

Source: Player's Handbook

_Evocation cantrip_

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 120 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

A beam of crackling energy streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10+CHA force damage.

**_At Higher Levels._** The spell creates more than one beam when you reach higher levels: two beams at 5th level, three beams at 11th level, and four beams at 17th level. You can direct the beams at the same target or at different ones. Make a separate attack roll for each beam.

## Earth Fists
*Cantrip transmutation*

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Target:** A willing creature you touch  
**Components:** V S M (A clump of rough stone and clay)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute  
**Classes:** Druid, Cleric, Paladin, Warlock

You impart elemental energy into yours or a willing creature's hands. As you do so the target's hands are encrusted in magical stone. The target retains the dexterity of normal hands and can use their stone encrusted hands as they would normal hands. For the duration of the spell the target may make a melee spell attack against one creature within 5 feet with their fists, this attack deals 1d8 bludgeoning damage. The target can use the caster's spellcasting ability instead of Strength for the attack roll of the target's melee spell attack.  

Additionally, for the duration of the spell the target has advantage on checks made to initiate and maintain a grapple. 

Total immersion in water or exposure to heavy rainfall turns the hands to thick mud, making it impossible for the target to cast any spells with a somatic component, grasp or hold objects, or punch and smash with the fists, although they suffer no other ill effects.  

The spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

## Mind Sliver

Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything

_Enchantment cantrip_

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V  
**Duration:** 1 round

You drive a disorienting spike of psychic energy into the mind of one creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or take 1d6 psychic damage and subtract 1d4 from the next saving throw it makes before the end of your next turn.

**_At Higher Levels._** This spell’s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach certain levels: 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).
## Minor Illusion

Source: Player's Handbook

_Illusion cantrip_

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** S, M (a bit of fleece)  
**Duration:** 1 minute

You create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for the duration. The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an action or cast this spell again.

If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else’s voice, a lion’s roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends.

If you create an image of an object—such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest—it must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. The image can’t create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.

If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.

## Chill Touch

Source: Player's Handbook

_Necromancy cantrip_

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 120 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 1 round

You create a ghostly, skeletal hand in the space of a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the creature to assail it with the chill of the grave. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 necrotic damage, and it can’t regain hit points until the start of your next turn. Until then, the hand clings to the target. If you hit an undead target, it also has disadvantage on attack rolls against you until the end of your next turn.

**_At Higher Levels._** This spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

## Shape Water

Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything

_Transmutation cantrip_

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous or 1 hour

You choose an area of water that you can see within range and that fits within a 5-foot cube. You manipulate it in one of the following ways:

- You instantaneously move or otherwise change the flow of the water as you direct, up to 5 feet in any direction. This movement doesn’t have enough force to cause damage.

- You cause the water to form into simple shapes and animate at your direction. This change lasts for 1 hour.

- You change the water’s color or opacity. The water must be changed in the same way throughout. This change lasts for 1 hour.

- You freeze the water, provided that there are no creatures in it. The water unfreezes in 1 hour.

If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have no more than two of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.

## Toll the Dead

Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything

_Necromancy cantrip_

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You point at one creature you can see within range, and the sound of a dolorous bell fills the air around it for a moment. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 1d8 necrotic damage. If the target is missing any of its hit points, it instead takes 1d12 necrotic damage.

**_At Higher Levels._** The spell’s damage increases by one die when you reach 5th level (2d8 or 2d12), 11th level (3d8 or 3d12), and 17th level (4d8 or 4d12).

# Level 1
## Soul Drain Armour
*1st-Level Abjuration*
**Casting Time:** 1 Action (ritual)
**Range:** Self
**Components:** V, S, M (A polished iron bowl)
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You suffuse a portion of your own life force into a pearl of energy. 
Upon casting the spell, the caster can choose to sacrifice a number of max HP equal to the full value of one of their hit die. This sacrificed HP is coalesced into a pearl of energy that can be consumed by any creature as a bonus action to gain temporary HP equivalent to the amount sacrificed. Once the caster completes a long rest or if the pearl is not consumed in 24 hours, the pearl vanishes and the caster regains the sacrificed max HP.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 1st level or higher, the caster may sacrifice one additional hit die of max HP for each slot level above 1st.

# Level 2

## Invisibility 

_2nd-level illusion_

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, S, M (an eyelash encased in gum arabic)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

A creature you touch becomes invisible until the spell ends. Anything the target is wearing or carrying is invisible as long as it is on the target’s person. The spell ends for a target that attacks or casts a spell.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.

## Mind Thrust

_2nd-level enchantment_

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 1 round

You thrust a lance of psychic disruption into the mind of one creature you can see within range. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 3d6 psychic damage, and it can’t take a reaction until the end of its next turn. Moreover, on its next turn, it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and suffers none of the spell’s other effects.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

# Level 3

## Counterspell
_3rd-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when you see a creature within 60 feet of you casting a spell  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, its spell fails and has no effect. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a success, the creature’s spell fails and has no effect.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the interrupted spell has no effect if its level is less than or equal to the level of the spell slot you used.

## Major Image

_3rd-level illusion_

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 120 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of fleece)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. The image appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems completely real, including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to the thing depicted. You can’t create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature (like a troglodyte’s stench).

As long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the spell lasts until dispelled, without requiring your concentration. In this form it is sometimes considered a different spell, known as Permanent Image.

## Summon Undead

Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything

_3rd-level necromancy_

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 90 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a gilded skull worth at least 300 gp)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You call forth an undead spirit. It manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. This corporeal form uses the Undead Spirit stat block. When you cast the spell, choose the creature’s form: Ghostly, Putrid, or Skeletal. The spirit resembles an undead creature with the chosen form, which determines certain traits in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

The creature is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its move to avoid danger.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, use the higher level wherever the spell’s level appears in the stat block.

## Thunder Step

Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything

_3rd-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 90 ft  
**Components:** V  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You teleport yourself to an unoccupied space you can see within range. Immediately after you disappear, a thunderous boom sounds, and each creature within 10 feet of the space you left must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 3d10 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The thunder can be heard from up to 300 feet away.

You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn’t exceed what you can carry. You can also teleport one willing creature of your size or smaller who is carrying gear up to its carrying capacity. The creature must be within 5 feet of you when you cast this spell, and there must be an unoccupied space within 5 feet of your destination space for the creature to appear in; otherwise, the creature is left behind.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 3rd.

## Sickening Radiance

_4th-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 120 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Dim, greenish light spreads within a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. The light spreads around corners, and it lasts until the spell ends.

When a creature moves into the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 4d10 radiant damage, and it suffers one level of exhaustion and emits a dim, greenish light in a 5-foot radius. This light makes it impossible for the creature to benefit from being invisible. The light and any levels of exhaustion caused by this spell go away when the spell ends.

## Shadow Of Moil

_4th-level necromancy_

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S, M (an undead eyeball encased in a gem worth at least 150 gp)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Flame-like shadows wreathe your body until the spell ends, causing you to become heavily obscured to others. The shadows turn dim light within 10 feet of you into darkness, and bright light in the same area to dim light.

Until the spell ends, you have resistance to radiant damage. In addition, whenever a creature within 10 feet of you hits you with an attack, the shadows lash out at that creature, dealing it 2d8 necrotic damage.

## Raulothim's Psychic Lance 
Source: Fizban's Treasury of Dragons

_4th-level Enchantment_

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 120 feet  
**Components:** V  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You unleash a shimmering lance of psychic power from your forehead at a creature that you can see within range. Alternatively, you can utter a creature’s name. If the named target is within range, it becomes the spell’s target even if you can’t see it. If the named target isn’t within range, the lance dissipates without effect.

The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 7d6 psychic damage and is incapacitated until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t incapacitated.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 4th.
